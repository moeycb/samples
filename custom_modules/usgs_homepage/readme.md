# USGS Homepage
## Developer: Marvin Oey

This module provides a unique homepage for the USGS.  The reason for developing  a custom module as opposed to using a contributed module was that the USGS was maing constant changes to how the homepage would behave.  It provde useful to simply create some custom theme functions and introduce new tpl.php files to allow for front-end devs as well as backend to work together easily.
