The program&rsquo;s work has been featured in national and international media coverage, culminated in a Vice-Presidential briefing and visit to the Park in 1997, and was recently featured at several international science conferences. \r\n<p>Fagre has employed a number of innovative means for sharing results of the team&rsquo;s research. Most recently, their work was highlighted on an electronic field trip involving 160 schools in 20 states. \"Fagre has successfully established a global change research program and team that conducts outstanding research \" states Dr. Rey Stendell, Director of the USGS&rsquo;s Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Colorado, the office which oversees Fagre&rsquo;s work at Glacier National Park. \"Equally important, he has communicated important climate issues to natural resource managers and the public in an understandable and usable way. We are very proud of his accomplishments.\" \r\n<p>Fagre received his undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from Prescott College, Arizona and graduate degrees in Animal Ecology from the University of California-Davis. He and his family reside in West Glacier, Montana. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Montana"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"931924800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169297"},{"tid":"170130"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
