This information is important in the event of an accidental contaminant spill and to model water quality and aquatic life in the river.<\/p>\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s red dye injection is the second and final to occur in this Missouri River study. The first injection occurred at the Toston Dam near Townsend on Aug. 30.<\/p>\r\n<p>Rhodamine WT, the red dye used in this study, is non-toxic and safe for the environment. The dye plumes will be monitored as they travel downstream. Although the red dye may be quite visible near the two release sites, it will quickly become diluted, and at most points downstream it will be detectable only with specialized instruments. Environmental Protection Agency regulations require that the maximum concentrations of Rhodamine WT dye at municipal water supplies be no greater than 10 micrograms per liter. To ensure compliance with EPA regulation, the USGS has designed the study to reduce the maximum concentrations at all surface water intake locations to 5 micrograms per liter.<\/p>\r\n<p>Studies like this have been conducted across the country.
