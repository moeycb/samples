As a child you may have remembered your mother snatching a tick off your arm as its tiny legs held tight.\n\nTicks can be a nuisance and their bites can cause irritation.\u00c2\u00a0 More importantly, ticks have the distinction of spreading the widest variety of disease producing agents that are harmful to humans.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/health.usgs.gov\/vector_zoonotic\/lyme.html\">Lyme disease<\/a> is the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere and if left untreated infection can spread to the joints, the heart and even the nervous system.\n\n<strong>\u00c2\u00a0Lyme Disease History<\/strong>\n\nThe disease was initially named after the town of Lyme, Conn.where a number of cases were first reported in 1975.\u00c2\u00a0 The emergence of the disease infected ticks has been linked to changing land use patterns as forested areas were cleared for agriculture and the white-tailed deer population dwindled in the late 1800s in the north eastern United States.\u00c2\u00a0 The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/ticks\/life_cycle_and_hosts.html\">black-legged tick<\/a>, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeer tick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the principle vector, or carrier of Lyme disease, made a comeback with the return of forested habitat in mid-1900s and the risk of human infection increased.\n\nSince the mid-1970s Lyme disease has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/lyme\/stats\/maps\/map2010.html\">spread<\/a> throughout New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the northernMidwest with cases reported in nearly every state.\n\n<strong>USGS Science and Lyme Disease<\/strong>\n\nAlthough the black-legged tick can be found throughout the Eastern United States, scientists were baffled as to why the Lyme disease cases were not found in all the places where the ticks carrying it were found.\u00c2\u00a0 The USGS has collaborated with several universities in a National Science Foundation funded <a href=\"http:\/\/wildlifehealth.tennessee.edu\/lyme_gradient\/index.htm\">study<\/a> to better comprehend the ecological drivers for the geographic disparity in Lyme disease risk in the Eastern United States.\n\nData on tick-host relationships, seasonal tick biology, and tick genetics will be studied after they are collected in nine separate <a href=\"http:\/\/wildlifehealth.tennessee.edu\/lyme_gradient\/sites.htm\">field sites<\/a> around the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwrc.usgs.gov\/resshow\/ginsberg\/index.cfm\">Dr. Howard Ginsberg<\/a>, a USGS Research Ecologist with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwrc.usgs.gov\/\">Patuxent Wildlife Research Center<\/a>, is a Principle Investigator with the project.\u00c2\u00a0 He explains that the application of modeling tools will help to shed light on the ecological processes liable for the variation in Lyme disease cases and may help to predict how climate change could affect this risk. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLyme disease is a major public health problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Ginsberg \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the reasons for its geographical distribution are ecological. The knowledge to be gained from this project will help us better predict the future distribution of this disease, and lower the risk to human health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe goal of the study is to better understand how the relationships between ticks, their hosts, and environmental factors influence disease transmission, which can lead to improved tick control measures and public awareness on the regional variation in the risk of Lyme disease.\n\n<strong>What are the Signs and Symptoms of Lyme Disease?<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173841\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere and if left untreated infection can spread to the joints, the heart and even the nervous system.
