Known as &ldquo;strategic habitat conservation&rdquo; or SHC, it is a way of doing business that requires the agencies and partners to set biological goals for priority species populations, inform and make strategic resource management decisions and constantly reassess and improve conservation actions&mdash;all critical steps in dealing with large-scale conservation challenges and the uncertainty of accelerated climate change.<\/p>\r\n<p>The agreement calls for the Service and USGS to collaborate closely, working as long-term partners to encourage common goals, a shared sense of purpose, and a defined operational framework. &nbsp;Fish and Wildlife Service Director Sam Hamilton and USGS Director Dr. Marcia McNutt signed the agreement.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To view the full agreement and learn more about Service and USGS landscape conservation efforts, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/science\/shc\/index.html\">U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Landscape Conservation Web site<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" id=\"gallery_news\" name=\"NR2010_01_14\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photo_shares\/thumbs\/tags\/NR2010_01_14\/1\" title=\"Image Gallery\">[Access images for this release at: &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_01_14\" mce_href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_01_14\"&amp;amp;amp;gt;http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_01_14&amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;gt;]<\/iframe><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Adaptive Management","Strategic Habitat Conservation","","Fish And Wildlife Service","Wildlife Conservation","Climate Change"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1263445200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169020"},{"tid":"169182"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
