Future carbon stocks are inextricably linked to these drivers because as ecosystems, forests or agricultural lands are converted for other uses, their ability to capture and store carbon is affected.\n\n<strong>From the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coastal Waters<\/strong>\n\nThe area USGS studied extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coastal waters, and totals just over 1 million square miles. The major ecosystems evaluated were terrestrial -- forests, wetlands, agricultural lands, and shrublands and grasslands -- and aquatic -- rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters.
