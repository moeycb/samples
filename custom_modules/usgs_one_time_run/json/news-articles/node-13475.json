Two contributing factors are low vegetation cover and disturbance to soil surfaces.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Accelerated rates of dust emission have important implications for natural systems and human well-being, so developing a better understanding of how climate and land-use change may affect arid landscapes is an important and emerging area of research,\" said Seth Munson, a USGS ecologist based in Denver.&nbsp; He continued and said, \"our results from long-term monitoring of climate and vegetation on public land in the southwestern United States suggest that years with low precipitation and high temperatures are related to low plant cover, which can accelerate the likelihood of dust production, especially on disturbed soil surfaces.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Vegetation contributes to ecological integrity. The presence of plants reduces soil erosion and dust storms, because it keeps the soil intact, reduces wind momentum, and traps moving soil particles (see figure below). In spaces between the plants, many undisturbed desert soils are naturally armored by hardened physical and biological crusts.<\/p>\r\n<p>Low vegetation cover can especially be a problem in drought years in abandoned agricultural fields, which are generally dominated by annual plants. This means that the consequences of dust storms, including motor vehicle crashes, are high in a drought year and low in years with more precipitation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Similarly, in places where land-use activities destroy or reduce soil crusts and weaken soil stability, experts know to assume higher dust storm activity than in places where soils are left undisturbed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Future climate scenarios predict that drought conditions will worsen, and therefore more dust storms are likely. Nevertheless, site restoration and reduced disturbance can mitigate some of the factors that promote dust emission. The USGS and land managers are working together to better understand the causes and sources of dust storm activity in the southwestern United States.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"625\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2011_10_11\/dust-storm-risk_tn.jpg\" alt=\"The presence of plants reduces soil erosion and dust storms because it keeps the soil intact, reduces wind momentum, and traps moving soil particles.
