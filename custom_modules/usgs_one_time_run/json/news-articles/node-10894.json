The Gulf hypoxic zone is an area where oxygen levels drop too low to support most life in bottom and near-bottom waters. Estimated nutrient contributions from October 2007 through June 2008 are available at <a href=\"http:\/\/toxics.usgs.gov\/hypoxia\/mississippi\/oct_jun\/index.html\">http:\/\/toxics.usgs.gov\/hypoxia\/mississippi\/oct_jun\/index.html<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The large nutrient contributions are primarily due to near record-breaking streamflows this spring (April through June) in the Mississippi River Basin. Streamflows were about 50 percent higher this year compared to the long-term spring average flows since about 1980. Nutrient contributions for a given spring vary depending on the amount of flow in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin, as well as average stream water nutrient concentrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Contributions of phosphorus to the Gulf of Mexico are estimated to be the highest for the USGS record since the 1980s. Total phosphorus (83,000 tons) and dissolved orthophosphate (26,000 tons) are about 60 and 85 percent higher than the long-term spring average for the nearly 30-year period.<\/p>\r\n<p>Similarly, nitrogen contributions to the Gulf of Mexico from April through June are estimated to be about 35 to 40 percent higher than the long-term spring average since the early 1980s. Contributions for total nitrogen and dissolved nitrate during the three months are estimated to be about 817,000 and 578,000 tons, respectively.<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS releases preliminary estimates of monthly nutrient fluxes from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to the Gulf of Mexico in early July each year for the previous nine months (October through June). These estimates are used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other researchers for modeling the areal extent of the hypoxic zone.<\/p>\r\n<p>Final USGS nutrient fluxes are based on streamflows and nutrient information for the full water year (through September 2008), and will be available in 2009 after data are finalized.
