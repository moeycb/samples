Summer sea ice is retreating far north of the shallow continental shelf waters of the Chukchi Sea in U.S. and Russian waters, a condition that did not occur a decade ago.\u00c2\u00a0 To keep up with their normal resting periods between feeding bouts to the seafloor, walruses have simply hauled out onto shore.\n\nHauling out refers to the behavior associated with seals and walruses of temporarily leaving the water for sites on land or ice.\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pF-aNYhCr8k\">Watch a video<\/a> that explains USGS research and the haul-out phenomenon.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/09_15_2010_qul8OBa44I_09_15_2010_4\"><img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/09_15_2010\/qul8OBa44I_09_15_2010\/medium\/walrus_haul_out_USGS_09-10IMG_8454.jpg\" alt=\"Walrus Calf Looking out From the Group Near Pt Lay, AK\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> Walrus calf. Calves are more likely to be trampled in these massive land haul-outs.[\/caption]\n\nThe USGS is <a href=\"http:\/\/alaska.usgs.gov\/science\/biology\/walrus\/2014animation.html\">tracking walruses<\/a> in the eastern Chukchi Sea with satellite radio-tags to better understand how sea-ice retreat is affecting these large pinnipeds. The resulting tracking data are not only helping researchers and managers alike better understand changing walrus movements, foraging areas, and use of sea ice habitats in the Chukchi Sea oil lease sale planning area, but they are also providing insights on changes in walrus activity levels during these minimum sea-ice conditions in the summer, which can affect their ability to store fat.\n\nThe population-level effects of these hauling out behavioral changes are not yet understood; however, USGS and other researchers do know that while onshore, young walruses are susceptible to mortality from trampling. Additionally, hauling out on shore and using nearshore feeding areas may be energetically less profitable than their preferred behavior of using the ice as a haulout platform on which to rest while remaining near rich feeding grounds.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/08_18_2010_h41Ogs6FEa_08_18_2010_8#.VCxUvPldV8F\"><img src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_18_2010\/h41Ogs6FEa_08_18_2010\/medium\/walrus_pup_2010_Norseman_Sarah_Sonsthagen.jpg\" alt=\"Walrus Female And Pup On An Ice Floe\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a> Walrus female and pup on an ice floe in June 2010.[\/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlthough the longer open water season in the Arctic is creating opportunities for shipping, tourism, energy production and other human activities in this remote region, it is also resulting in significant ecological changes. Data from these studies will provide resource managers with basic information on areas important for walruses, such as the Hanna Shoal region in the northeastern Chukchi Sea, as human activities in the Arctic increase. The areas of walrus foraging overlap with oil and gas lease blocks administered by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\n<strong>Useful links:<\/strong>\n\nFull-Length USGS Video: <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/600#.VCxPuCldX8s\">Tracking Pacific Walrus: Expedition to the Shrinking Chukchi Sea Ice<\/a>\n\nUSGS Alaska Science Center <a href=\"http:\/\/alaska.usgs.gov\/science\/biology\/walrus\/index.html\">Walrus webpage<\/a>\n\nPress Release (September 2014): <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3993&amp;from=rss#.VCxQVyldX8s\">Research Shows Historic Decline in Pacific Walrus Population<\/a>\n\nAerial <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/307#.VCwUySldUzA\">video footage<\/a> of 2010 haul out\n\nBlog: Tracking Walrus: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/tracking-pacific-walrus-expedition-to-the-shrinking-chukchi-sea-ice\/\">Expedition to the Shrinking Chukchi Sea<\/a>\n\nThe Science Behind the 2011 <a href=\"http:\/\/alaska.usgs.gov\/science\/biology\/walrus\/pdfs\/Walrus_FAQ.pdf\">Walrus Haul-Out FAQs<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"\/Users\/anewman\/Downloads\/New%20model%20gives%20insight%20to%20the%20potential%20future%20of%20the%20Pacific%20walrus\">Podcast with USGS walrus researcher<\/a> on changes in the ice-dominated ecosystems of the Arctic and effects on Pacific walruses\n\nOther Related Press Releases:\n\n11\/14\/2012 -<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3453\" target=\"_blank\"> USGS Study Tracks Pacific Walrus, Observes Effects of Arctic Sea Ice Loss on Behavior<\/a>\n\n9\/13\/2011 -<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2935&amp;from=rss#.UCQZCY5FEvQ\" target=\"_blank\"> New Video\/Images of Walrus Haulout<\/a>\n\n8\/16\/2011 -<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2882#.UCQYxY5FEvQ\" target=\"_blank\"> USGS August 16, 2011 Pacific Walruses Studied as Sea Ice Melts<\/a>\n\n9\/22\/2010 - \u00c2\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><a href=\"http:\/\/us.vocuspr.com\/Newsroom\/Query.aspx?SiteName=fws&amp;Entity=PRAsset&amp;SF_PRAsset_PRAssetID_EQ=111773&amp;XSL=PressRelease&amp;Cache=True\" target=\"_blank\">USFWS September 22, 2010 North Slope Walrus Haul-out Update<\/a><\/span>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24366","uid":"31","filename":"Main.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Main.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"111012","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"3018522b-45d3-4ab8-bc17-e4898aaa96f2","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["ArcticIce","Biology and Ecosystems","ClimateAndArctic","climatechange","GlobalWarming","Ice-DependentAnimals","PacificWalrus","RetreatingIce","WalrusAndIce"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1412192164","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
