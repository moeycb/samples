These are just a few of the over more than million page views the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/10132\/3814\">USGS FAQ site<\/a> gets in a year. This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top questions mainly focused on hazards, with earthquake questions being the most frequent. The most commonly visited FAQ was: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9830\/3278\" target=\"_blank\">Can you predict earthquakes?<\/a>\u00c2&nbsp;The answer is no, neither the USGS nor any other scientists have ever predicted a major earthquake. They do not know how, and they do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future. However based on scientific data, probabilities can be calculated for potential future earthquakes.\u00c2&nbsp;And USGS is working on an <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/research\/earlywarning\/\">earthquake early warning system<\/a> that may eventually provide seconds-to-minutes of advance warning.

How are earthquakes measured? How is the magnitude of an earthquake determined?<\/a> Scientists use <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=magnitude\">magnitude<\/a> to characterize the relative size of an earthquake. It is based on measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a\u00c2&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=seismograph\">seismograph<\/a>, and the most commonly used are (1) local magnitude (ML), commonly referred to as &quot;Richter magnitude,&quot; (2) surface-wave magnitude (Ms), (3) body-wave magnitude (Mb), and (4) moment magnitude (Mw).\u00c2&nbsp;The different measurement scales then begs the question (from almost 11,000 people): <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9828\/3357\" target=\"_blank\">What are the different magnitude scales and why are there so many?<\/a>\u00c2&nbsp;Each magnitude is valid for a particular frequency range and type of seismic signal.\u00c2&nbsp;Because of the limitations of all three magnitude scales, ML, mb, and Ms, a new, more uniformly applicable extension of the magnitude scale, known as <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=magnitude\">moment magnitude<\/a>, or Mw, was developed. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9819\/2729\" target=\"_blank\">How do volcanoes erupt?<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2&nbsp;broke up the list of earthquake questions, with most visits to that FAQ page coming after the eruption of Kileaua Volcano in Hawaii that began on June 27.\u00c2&nbsp; And then it was back to earthquakes: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9830\/3279\">Can animals predict earthquakes?<\/a> Although there is anecdotal evidence of animals exhibiting strange behavior, consistent and reliable behavior before a seismic event has not been documented A key question about safety during an earthquake was also quite frequently visited, with people wondering, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9834\/3331\">What should I do during an earthquake?<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d What you should do varies a bit based on where you are, inside, outside, driving, or in a mountainous area. And <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9834\/3334%20\">after an earthquake<\/a> there are also steps you can take to protect yourself.

When such a large volume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides or collapses into the emptied space, to form a huge depression called a caldera. Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and several kilometers deep. So how many types are there?\u00c2&nbsp;There are three <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9819\/2730\" target=\"_blank\">types of volcanoes<\/a>:\u00c2&nbsp;Cinder cone\/Scoria cone, Composite volcanoes\/Stratovolcanoes, and\u00c2&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/images\/pglossary\/ShieldVolcano.php\" target=\"_blank\">Shield volcanoes<\/a>. Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. Some of the Earth&#39;s grandest mountains Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador, Mount Shasta in California, Mount Hood in Oregon, Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington are composite volcanoes -- sometimes called stratovolcanoes.\u00c2&nbsp; They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. And how many active volcanoes are there? There are about 1500 potentially active volcanoes, and about 500 have erupted in historical time. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll finish of the most frequently visited FAQs list with: \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/categories\/9755\/3141\" target=\"_blank\">What is the difference between a tsunami and a tidal wave?<\/a> Good question. Both are sea waves, but a tsunami and a tidal wave are two different and unrelated phenomenona. A <a href=\"http:\/\/tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov\/publications\/glossary2.pdf\">tidal wave<\/a> is the wave motion of the tides. A tidal wave is a shallow water wave caused by the gravitational interactions between the Sun, Moon, and Earth.\u00c2&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tsunami.noaa.gov\/terminology.html\">Tsunamis<\/a> are ocean waves triggered by large earthquakes that occur near or under the ocean, volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides, and by onshore landslides in which large volumes of debris fall into the water.\u00c2&nbsp;Tsunamis cause major damage and loss of life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTidal wave\u00e2\u0080\u009d used to be the popular term for what are actually tsunamis.
