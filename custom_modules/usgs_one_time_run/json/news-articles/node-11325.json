Many international\r\ndebates have occurred over names and boundaries of units, and various time\r\nscales have been used by the geoscience community. To help remedy differences,\r\nthe USGS and the AASG developed &quot;<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2007\/3015\/\">Divisions of Geologic Time-Major Chronostratigraphic\r\nand Geochronologic Units<\/a>.&quot;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;AASG considered the development of a\r\nnational standard time scale to be of critical importance to geologists around the\r\ncountry engaged in the production of geologic maps,&quot; said Alabama State\r\nGeologist Nick Tew, who represented the AASG in development of the updated\r\ngeologic time scale. &quot;The AASG was happy to work with our colleagues at USGS in\r\ndevelopment of the updated time scale.&quot;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUSGS provides science for a changing world.
