One graphic shows that shaking levels double from the edge of the Los Angeles basin, where the sediments are thin, to the middle of the basin, in the heart of Los Angeles, where soft sediments reach a depth of four miles.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fact sheet, which includes downloadable color images, is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/geopubs.wr.usgs.gov\/fact-sheet\/fs001-01\/\">http:\/\/geopubs.wr.usgs.gov\/fact-sheet\/fs001-01\/<\/a>. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"979621200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
