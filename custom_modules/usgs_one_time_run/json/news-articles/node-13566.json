What is the general shape of the subsurface aquifers? These answers could potentially refine our knowledge on seismic hazards and how much water is in the aquifers beneath the Great Sand Dunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS is contracting with Fugro Airborne Surveys Corp., Canada, to conduct the geophysical survey.&nbsp; The helicopter is controlled by experienced pilots who are specially trained for low-level flying. &nbsp;The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure flights are in accordance with U.S. law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Editor:&nbsp; In the public interest and in accordance with FAA regulations, the USGS is announcing this low-level airborne project.
