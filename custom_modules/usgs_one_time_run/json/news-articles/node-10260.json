The Red Cross and other disaster-relief agencies agreed to underwrite the cost of producing the booklet and three months later the booklet was ready to go to press. \r\n<p>The booklet explained why scientists believe that at least one large earthquake is likely to occur in the Bay area by 2020, and what residents can do to prepare and reduce damage. These estimates used in the booklet were based on the 1990 USGS report, \"Probabilities of Large Earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Region, California.\" An updated probabilities report, based on earthquake research conducted in the past decade will be released by the USGS on Oct. 14, 1999. \"The new report will emphasize that the earthquake hazard exists throughout the entire Bay region,\" said USGS researcher Mary Lou Zoback, \"making the preparedness message of \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Next Big Earthquake.......&rsquo; more vital than ever.\" \r\n<p>Copies of \"The Next Big Earthquake\" are available at the USGS Earth Science Information Center at 345 Middlefield Road in Menlo Park; at many Bay Area Red Cross centers; or by calling the USGS at 650-329-4085.
