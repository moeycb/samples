However, it is very unlikely that this circulation will collapse or that the weakening will occur abruptly during the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century and beyond. <\/li>\r\n<li>An abrupt change in sea level is possible, but predictions are highly uncertain due to shortcomings in existing climate models. <\/li>\r\n<li>There is unlikely to be an abrupt release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere from deposits in the earth. However, it is very likely that the pace of methane emissions will increase.\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\"><span class=\"episode_title_text\">How Abrupt Can Climate Change Be?<\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absMiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep84\/20090209_84_SAP2.mp3.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=84\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/>or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The U.S. Geological Survey led the new assessment, which was authored by a team of climate scientists from the federal government and academia. The report was commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program with contributions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"This report was truly a collaborative effort between world renowned scientists who provided objective, unbiased information that is necessary to develop effective adaptation and mitigation strategies that protect our livelihood,\" said USGS Director Mark Myers. \"It summarizes the scientific community's growing understanding regarding the potential for abrupt climate changes and identifies areas for additional research to further improve climate models.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the potential for abrupt changes in climate. For example, the report's scientists found that processes such as interaction of warm ocean waters with the periphery of ice sheets and ice shelves have a greater impact than previously known on the destabilization of ice sheets that might accelerate sea-level rise.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Climate Change","glaciers","drought"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1229403600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169633"},{"tid":"169730"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
