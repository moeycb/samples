A wider area was searched for the sea squirt this year, and it was mapped over about twice the area observed in 2004.<!--introend--> Results show that the species is present in two adjacent areas totaling 88 square miles in U.S. waters near the U.S.-Canada boundary. The very large mat-like colonies observed in 2004 have been replaced by fewer smaller ones. The Georges Bank occurrence is the largest known infestation of colonial sea squirts in a major offshore fishing ground.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the University of Rhode Island (URI) conducted the survey aboard the NOAA Ship <em>Delaware II<\/em> during the last two weeks of August 2005. In the 2004 survey, the sea squirt colony was mapped over 40 square miles before weather truncated the cruise. This year&rsquo;s wider survey showed it to be present over at least 67 square miles of the same general area. Scientists also discovered an additional infestation of 21 square miles, possibly in an early stage, that lies 10 miles to the east of the original observations, in an area now closed to fishing.<\/p>\r\n<p>The research team also surveyed three sites in Canadian waters where seabed conditions are similar to those on the U.S. part of the bank and found no evidence of the sea squirt.<\/p>\r\n<p>The mats were observed on gravel substrate that is highly productive for fish and sea scallops on the northern edge of Georges Bank. Video and photo transects made using the USGS seabed observation and sampling system (SeaBOSS) documented the distribution of the colonies in water depths of 45 to 65 meters (145 to 213 feet).<\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists will analyze data collected on the cruise to determine if the tunicate invasion has the potential to alter seabed communities that sustain commercial fish species. There is concern that the sea squirt mats could form a barrier between fish and their prey that live in the seabed. Moreover, as no organisms have been observed to grow on the mats, it is possible that the tunicates would be an unfavorable surface for the settlement of scallop larvae and larvae of other species. Samples of the tunicate will be evaluated to determine its nutritional value to predators, and to confirm identification of the species through DNA analysis.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sea squirts are tunicates, a type of sea life with a primitive spinal cord in the larval stage and a firm, flexible outer covering in the adult stage called a &quot;tunic,&quot; from which the name derives. The Georges Bank occurrence is of the genus <em>Didemnum<\/em>. They form dense mats, made of thousands of minute individuals, by attaching to firm substrates such as gravel, sea scallops, mussels, docks and other structures, and even seaweed. Tunicates can overgrow sea scallops and mussels, and they may affect other species of clams and worms that live in the seabed below the tunicate colony. Invasive species are plants or animals that move into new areas and displace native species, or native species that overgrow and damage an ecosystem.<\/p>\r\n<p>This tunicate can reproduce and spread either sexually or asexually (by budding.) The free-swimming tadpoles produced by sexual reproduction live only a few hours before attaching to the seabed and forming new colonies. By contrast, fragments of colonies are long-lived and can be spread by tidal and storm currents. Controlled experiments in Cape Cod waters by USGS and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution scientists have shown that small pieces removed from sea squirt colonies increase dramatically by budding in a matter of weeks. Thus, fragmentation of tunicate mats could promote the spread of the species.<\/p>\r\n<p>The species is known to thrive in marine environments that lie within its preferred temperature range","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1126497600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169347"},{"tid":"170555"},{"tid":"170602"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
