This is a congressionally mandated matching-funds program, meaning every federal dollar awarded is matched with university funds.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Geologic maps record the distribution of rock and soil materials at Earth&rsquo;s surface and help decision makers identify and protect valuable resources, avoid risks from natural hazards, and make wise land use choices,&rdquo; said Randy Orndorff, Associate Program Coordinator for the USGS National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program. &ldquo;Through this grant opportunity, students can help map the geology of the United States while learning the trade through one-on-one mentoring from professional geologists.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Since 1996, the USGS has funded nearly 525 projects from 140 universities, and nearly 800 students have participated in the program. Maximum funds available include $17,500 for graduate projects and $10,000 for undergraduate projects.
