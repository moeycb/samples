The USGS has received reports of deaths from this event, and damage around Athens. \r\n<p>According to USGS scientists, today&rsquo;s earthquake occurred along a \"normal\" fault. In this type of faulting, movement is primarily vertical. Turkey&rsquo;s earthquake was produced along a \"strike-slip\" fault, the North Anatolian fault, in which movement is primarily lateral. \r\n<p>The area around Athens has a long history of earthquakes. The most recent damaging earthquakes occurred here on March 4, 1981, and March 7 -- three days later. Seismometers at the USGS in Golden, CO measured these earthquakes at magnitudes 6.4 and 5.5 respectively. Each of these events caused damage and one death. \r\n<p>About 1200 moderate earthquakes (magnitude 5.0-5.9) occur each year throughout the world, according to data compiled since 1900. Through August this year, about 576 moderate earthquakes were recorded in the world.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"936676800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
