The hazards Web site highlights resources and information available from the USGS and provides links to the individual hazards Web pages for more detailed information. The Web site and fact sheets can be accessed at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/hazards\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/hazards<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&quot;At the USGS, it is our goal to provide scientific research and analysis that help the public make informed decisions on where natural hazards occur, how severe they may be, how to react to each hazard and how to safeguard people and communities,&quot; said USGS Acting Director P. Patrick Leahy. &quot;If we can use our science to help save lives and minimize the damage caused by natural hazards, we have achieved an enormous goal&mdash;helping to prevent natural hazards from becoming disasters.&quot;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS has the lead federal responsibility to provide notifications to the public about earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides. These notifications enhance public safety and reduce losses through effective forecasts and warnings based on the best possible scientific information. The USGS plays a supportive role to other federal agencies for flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, tsunamis and coastal storms.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1153886400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169087"},{"tid":"169491"},{"tid":"170469"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
