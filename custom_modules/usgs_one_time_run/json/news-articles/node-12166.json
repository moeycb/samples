A new maximum streamflow of 3,800 cubic feet per second at the Mauvais Coulee near Cando, N.D. streamgage was set on April 14, breaking the previous peak streamflow near Cando of 3,000 cubic feet per second during the 1997 flood.&nbsp; Peak flows on Edmore and Starkweather Coulees are similar to flows recorded during the 2009 flood.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since early April, four USGS hydrographers have been servicing the six streamflow gaging stations and six water level gages in the Devils Lake Basin and measuring streamflow and water levels at all stations,&rdquo; said Gregg Wiche, director of the USGS North Dakota Water Science Center. &ldquo;The USGS data are used by various National, State, and local agencies for flood forecasts, the operation of dams, the design of levees, and decision making.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS collects data from more than 100 streamgages in North Dakota, most of which provide real-time data that is transmitted every hour.
