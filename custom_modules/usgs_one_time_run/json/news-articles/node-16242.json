USGS scientists study sea otters to help the threatened species continue to recover from near extinction.[\/caption]\n\nSocial, fun-seeking, comedic, and sometimes feisty, sea otters are endearing because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a lot like us. Scientists now know that we have something else in common with sea otters: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3864#.U6B8N_ldUWK\">Both of us can get the flu<\/a>.\n\nDuring an August 2011 sea otter health monitoring project, scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<\/a> found that northern sea otters living off the coast of Washington state were exposed to the same flu virus that caused the 2009 world-wide pandemic in people. The exact date and source of exposure could not be determined, but <a href=\"http:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/20\/5\/13-1890_article\">the findings<\/a> suggest that human flu can infect sea otters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur study shows sea otters to be a newly identified animal host of influenza viruses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS scientist Hon Ip.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"180\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/377#.U62QY2K8Dah\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/animals\/sea_otters\/medium\/sea_otters%20(26).jpg\" alt=\"Kelp Forest\" width=\"180\" height=\"271\" \/><\/a> Sea otters are critical for the health of kelp forests.[\/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Compromised Cuties<\/strong>\n\nOtters are valuable beyond their child-like charisma:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sea otters are considered a <a href=\"http:\/\/soundwaves.usgs.gov\/2008\/11\/research.html\">keystone species of the kelp ecosystem<\/a> because they prey on plant-eating organisms that, if left unchecked, can destroy kelp beds and the fish habitat they provide.<\/li>\n\t<li>Scientists study sea otters as\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/on.doi.gov\/nearshore\">an indicator of nearshore ecosystem health<\/a>, since sea otters feed and live near the coast and often are the first predators exposed to pollutants and pathogens washed down from coastlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHowever, sea otters are also imperiled. These marine mammals were nearly killed off due to intensive fur harvesting in the 18<sup>th<\/sup> and 19<sup>th<\/sup> centuries. Today, two wild sea otter populations in the U.S. are <a href=\"http:\/\/ecos.fws.gov\/tess_public\/pub\/listedAnimals.jsp\">federally listed as threatened<\/a>, which makes otter diseases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including flu \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all the more dire.\n\n<strong>The 2009 Pandemic<\/strong>\n\nIf you or someone you know got sick from the 2009 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/h1n1flu\/qa.htm\">H1N1 influenza virus<\/a>, commonly called \u00e2\u0080\u009cswine flu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t alone. That year, the World Health Organization <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/csr\/disease\/swineflu\/en\/\">declared<\/a> the infection a pandemic. The CDC <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/h1n1flu\/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm\">estimates that<\/a> between 43 million and 89 million human cases of the H1N1 infection occurred in the United States between April 2009 and April 2010, causing up to 18,300 related deaths.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/07_01_2011_y17Gw33VVq_07_01_2011_4#.U6CQL_ldUWI\"><img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/07_01_2011\/y17Gw33VVq_07_01_2011\/medium\/LANDIS_IMG_0357.JPG\" alt=\"Sea Otter Hunt at Sunrise\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> USGS marine biologists set sail on a crisp September morning to capture and tag wild sea otters to monitor the health of this threatened species.[\/caption]\n\nThe H1N1 virus has spread globally among people since 2009 and was the predominant flu virus in circulation during the 2013-2014 flu season.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Otter Victims<\/strong>\n\nThe USGS and CDC researchers discovered antibodies for the 2009 H1N1 flu virus in blood samples from 70 percent of the sea otters studied during a 2011 otter health monitoring project. None of the otters were visibly sick, but the presence of antibodies means that they were previously exposed to influenza.\n\nFurther tests concluded that the antibodies were specific to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 flu virus, and not from exposure to other human or avian H1N1 viruses.\n\n<em>So, how did these animals get sick?<\/em>\n\nScientists aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis population of sea otters lives in a relatively remote environment and rarely comes into contact with humans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0said CDC scientist Zhunan Li.\n\nAn unrelated 2010 study showed that <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/fja4EQp10W_0\">northern elephant seals<\/a> sampled off the central California coast had also been infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. This elephant seal exposure is the only other known pandemic H1N1 influenza infection in marine mammals, and similar to sea otters, it is unclear how the seals were exposed.\n\nThe new study is the first time that evidence of influenza infection has been detected in sea otters, although these viruses have previously been found in many other animals, including ducks, chickens, \u00c2\u00a0pigs, whales, and the seals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur report identifies sea otters as another marine mammal species that is susceptible to influenza viruses and highlights the complex interspecies transmission of flu viruses in the marine environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS scientist LeAnn White.\n<div style=\"float: right;padding: 5px\" align=\"right\">[iframe title=\"Otter video\" name=\"Otter Video\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/w3Yw2wdQXzc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen]<\/div>\n<strong>USGS Research<\/strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><em>Sea otter flu and wildlife diseases:<\/em><\/strong> The<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS National Wildlife Health Center<\/a><strong> <\/strong>and the Department of the Interior work with CDC and other partners on research related to <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audios\/426#.U6DBWPldUWI\">zoonotic diseases<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u0094 diseases that can be passed between animals and humans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to help provide an early warning to the agriculture, public health and wildlife communities, and to the public.
