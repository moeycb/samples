USGS activities include 1) strengthening streamgages along the Gulf Coast; 2) implementing rapidly deployable, mobile gages on streams; 3) developing capabilities to measure hurricane-driven storm surges; and 4) installing an emergency satellite-communications and data-distribution system. These activities are coordinated with the National Weather Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other Federal, State, and local organizations. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;These coordinated actions will ensure timely and uninterrupted water information for forecasters, emergency managers, scientists and the general public,&quot; says Robert Hirsch, USGS Associate Director for Water. &quot;Improved flood monitoring and assessment will help reduce the risks to coastal communities, property, and human life.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, many USGS streamgages along and inland of the Gulf of Mexico were damaged or destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The damage resulted in interruptions of streamflow and water-level data needed during the storm by forecasters, emergency managers, and dam and levee operators. The USGS is currently strengthening or &quot;hardening&quot;120 gages along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas.&nbsp; A map of these locations is found at:<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/hurricanes\/index.html\"> http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/hurricanes\/index.html<\/a>.&nbsp; Additionally, 8 to 10 open-water tidal\/water-quality gages are being hardened in Mississippi and Louisiana. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe USGS has an extensive nation-wide network of more than 7,400 streamgages but it does not cover every stream in the country. Streamgage data is critical for emergency managers during storms, therefore, the USGS has developed new, rapidly deployable, mobile streamgages to provide short term, water-level data in unmonitored areas where flooding is anticipated. These mobile gages also serve as emergency replacements for damaged or destroyed gages. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita vividly demonstrated that storm surge can be as dangerous as riverine floods. In order to have information about the timing, extent, and magnitude of hurricane-driven surge waters and waves, the USGS has designed and developed a network of rugged, inexpensive water-level and barometric-pressure sensors, called storm-surge sensors.&nbsp; They can be installed quickly in anticipation of a storm. This information will be used to calibrate the storm-surge models used by forecasters along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and will help them provide improved forecasts of what lands will be inundated and to what depth in future hurricanes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, USGS water data are relayed almost hourly from streamgages to a single command-and-data acquisition station at Wallops Island, Va.&nbsp; Since this stat ion is located near the coast, it is vulnerable to hurricanes and other storms.&nbsp; Therefore, to ensure the continuity of continuous critical data in real time, the USGS and its partners are establishing an emergency satellite data acquisition and dissemination capability at the USGS EROS Data Center, located in Sioux Falls, S.D. This unit is expected to be operational by the end of 2007. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Expanded Participation in Satellite Charter<\/strong> \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUSGS has worked with commercial satellite i","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1179979200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"},{"tid":"169606"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
