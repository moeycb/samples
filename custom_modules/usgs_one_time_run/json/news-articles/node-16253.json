The outcome was the creation of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.disasterscharter.org\/home\">International Charter Space and Major Disasters<\/a>; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCharter\u00e2\u0080\u009d for short. You can think of the Charter as a one-stop-shop for impact maps \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an essential resource, since in many cases satellite data are the only practical method to assess current ground conditions after a disaster. Today, 15 space agencies that manage more than 30 satellites are part of the Charter, pooling their combined resources to ensure that spacefaring nations can quickly share their data for a humanitarian undertaking. Since its inception, the Charter has been activated more than 400 times. &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>U.S. Participation<\/strong> While the U.S. was not originally part of the Charter, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with its mighty fleet of meteorological satellites \u00e2\u0080\u0094soon became a member in 2001. The U.S. Earth-observing satellite fleet, including Landsat, was not officially part of the Charter until the U.S. Geological Survey joined in 2005. However, Landsat was used during the very first charter activation, in November 2000. After weeks of torrential rainfall, a small landside dammed up the Mangart Stream near the Italian border. The resulting pooled waters worked in tandem with the saturated slopes of Slovenia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mount Mangart to cause the mountainside to give way overnight. An estimated 1 million cubic meters (35 million cubic feet) of debris flowed into the Soca River, devastating a small village and killing seven people en route. The Charter was activated a few days later. Thirteen satellite images were used, including two Landsat images taken before the disaster. All of the satellite images were gathered into a geographic information system (GIS) where the damage was analyzed. Using Landsat and SPOT imagery, a land use map was quickly created. This helped data analysts show responders that, although the majority of damage occurred in areas covered by deciduous forest, there was also significant damage in agricultural and inhabited areas. In late 2004, a magnitude 9 earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami that affected Sumatra, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and southern India, killing more than 200,000 people. The Charter was activated three times to cover the large expanse of damage. Both-medium resolution data (Landsat, SPOT, Disaster Monitoring Constellation) and very high-resolution data (IKONOS, Quickbird) were used to map impacted areas and to calculate damage extent. This gave first responders an overview of the situation on the ground and provided them with information needed to plan relief logistics.

Hickman wanted to know why Landsat was not officially part of the Charter. Jones looked into the matter and quickly discovered that the Charter was keen to partner with USGS. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Charter was very interested in having USGS join because of Landsat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones recounts. Thus, in early 2005, USGS became an official participating agency of the Charter. While USGS had joined because of its Landsat resources, USGS membership brought a suite of other valuable satellite data to the Charter, including NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MODIS, ASTER, EO-1, and even photos taken from the International Space Station. Additionally, commercial high-resolution vendors contribute their data through USGS. Landsat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s combination of spatial and spectral resolution together with its 186-km (115-mile) image width makes its data particularly useful after hurricanes, fires, and volcanoes, and floods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very good for getting an overall extent of the disaster. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been very useful for the Charter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones shared. In late 2008, USGS made all Landsat data freely available, so anyone in the world could download data as soon as they reached the archive, usually within hours of acquisition. Since USGS runs the Landsat Mission Operations Center and it can task Landsat satellites to acquire data whenever they are over an affected area, its involvement in the Charter remains essential. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the main reasons we are involved \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to do the tasking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones said. This January, Landsat data were used when the Thames River flooded. A Landsat 8 image acquired on Jan. 7, 2014, was provided to the United Kingdom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Environment Agency through the Charter. Kyle Brown, a Senior Geomatics Analyst with the agency, was the Charter project manager for the call.
