Areas in Oregon, Idaho, California, Washington and Nevada experienced record-breaking floods caused by three storms between Dec. 19 and Jan. 31. Agencies from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwp.usace.army.mil\/Missions\/Water\/FloodReady.aspx\">federal, state and local governments will commemorate<\/a> the 50th anniversary of the Pacific Northwest 1964 Christmas flood starting Dec. 10.\n<h2>Flood Awareness<\/h2>\nDuring this holiday season, the 1964 Christmas flood reminds us that flooding is a national problem and can happen anytime, anywhere. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nws.noaa.gov\/hic\/index.shtml\">National Weather Service<\/a>,\u00c2\u00a0over the past 30 years, nationwide annual flood damages averaged $8.2 billion with 89 fatalities per year.\n\nThe Christmas flood of 1964 was driven by a series of storms, known as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/rain-for-thirsty-california\/\">atmospheric rivers or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpineapple expresses<\/a>,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that battered the region producing as much as 15 inches of rain in 24 hours at some locations. The combination of heavy rain, melting snow, and frozen ground caused extreme runoff, erosion and flooding.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a classic rain-on-snow event,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Marc Stewart a hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn addition to the rain, there were already several inches of water from the melting snow, so it was a big runoff event across a wide area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe flood caused record-breaking peak streamflows, transported large amounts of sediment, and inflicted extensive flood damage. \u00c2\u00a0However, in many areas storage in reservoirs and operation of flood-control facilities prevented far greater damage.\n<h2>Flood Mitigation<\/h2>\nToday, the USGS helps mitigate flood hazards by developing real-time\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/flood_inundation\/\">flood inundation mapping capabilities<\/a> and providing critical information about the nation's rivers and streams.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUSGS streamgages are vital for flood risk management,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mary Karen Scullion a Willamette Valley reservoir regulator with the Army Corps of Engineers in Portland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChanges at a gage upstream of our dam tells us how much more water is flowing into the reservoir. We cannot allow a dam to overfill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/streamstats\/\">Streamflow data<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0are vitally important for USGS partner agencies to forecast flood magnitude and timing, operate flood control systems, and manage emergency response.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWater managers from state and federal agencies manage river flows near major population areas like Salem or Portland as a system of control points and each control point has a specific target,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Scullion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a control point spikes, decisions are made that specifically address the needs of a population area. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when we need to decide how best to protect the region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_205911\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"402\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/12\/photo3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-205911 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/12\/photo3.jpg\" alt=\"Flooding on the Rogue River, Oregon, December 1964\" width=\"402\" height=\"302\" \/><\/a> Flooding on the Rogue River, Oregon, December 1964.
