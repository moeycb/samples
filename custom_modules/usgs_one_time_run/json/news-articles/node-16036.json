As of 3:13p.m. ET, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued <a href=\"http:\/\/wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov\/\">no warning of tsunami activity<\/a>.\n\nThe current version of the <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/pager\/events\/us\/c0008m6h\/\">USGS Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER) estimate<\/a> is that economic losses are most likely to be in the $10-100 million range, and fatalities are equally likely to be in the 10-100 range.\n\nThe earthquake struck in the southwestern part of Mexico between Acapulco and Oaxaca. As of this writing, 859 people in 144 cities throughout Mexico and the surrounding region had responded on the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/dyfi\/events\/us\/c0008m6h\/us\/form.en.disabled.html\">Did You Feel It?<\/a> website.\n\n<strong>History of strong earthquakes<\/strong>\n\nMexico is one of the most tectonically active countries in the world, and it experiences frequent significant earthquakes.

The focal mechanism and depth of the earthquake are consistent with its occurrence on the subduction zone interface between these plates, approximately 100 km northeast of the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos plate begins its decent into the mantle beneath Mexico. In the region of this earthquake, the Cocos plate moves approximately northeastwards at a rate of 60 mm\/yr.\n\nFor the most recent information on this earthquake, maps, and scientific and technical information, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/recenteqsww\/Quakes\/usc0008m6h.php#details\">Magnitude 7.4 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Oaxaca, Mexico<\/a>.","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24188","uid":"31","filename":"Featured-Image1-e1332279721312.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Featured-Image1-e1332279721312.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"50270","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"5eefd24c-93be-4f02-a2ad-5cac7bd49943","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":321,"width":525},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["earthquakes","Mexico","Natural Hazards"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1332273774","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
