These findings could change the way scientists model the movement of carbon between land, water, and the atmosphere.\n\nThe findings were recently published in a <em>Nature Geoscience<\/em> article entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ngeo\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ngeo1294.html\">Significant efflux of carbon dioxide from streams and rivers in the United States<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d by David Butman and Professor Peter Raymond of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, as part of David\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ph.D. thesis. Funding for the study was from NASA, NSF, and the USGS.\n\nButman and Raymond found that a significant amount of carbon accumulated by plant growth on land is decomposed, discharged into streams and rivers, and outgassed as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) into the atmosphere. It is estimated that streams and rivers release almost 100 million metric tons of carbon each year. This release is equal to a car burning 40 billion gallons of gasoline, enough to drive back and forth to the moon 3.4 million times.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"341\" caption=\"Average concentration at and distribution of USGS gauging stations used to calculated CO2 efflux from US streams and rivers.

The river and stream samples were collected at USGS gaging stations and the geospatial data was produced by both the USGS and EPA.\n\nThis research is being incorporated into the USGS LandCarbon effort to characterize the current and future fluxes of carbon influenced by both natural and anthropogenic processes. One part of this effort is looking at the potential for carbon storage in the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vegetation, soils, and sediments, which is known as biological carbon sequestration.
