Increased water flow can flush higher levels of iron and nitrate into coastal waters, and these compounds can radically alter the production of phytoplankton and zooplankton (tiny, free floating organisms), which serve as food for seabirds and fish such as salmon. Glacier runoff is of particular concern in the Copper River, which is the Gulf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest freshwater source and a major salmon production area. How will accelerated glacial melting over the next 50 years as a result of climate change affect the unique Gulf of Alaska and Copper River coastal ecosystems? USGS scientists are studying these processes and impacts.
