Additionally, the study demonstrated that <em>G. destructans<\/em> can be spread through contact between individual bats.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"While our study confirmed that <em>G. destructans<\/em> is spread bat-to-bat, it is also important to note that virtually all pathogens, especially spore-producing fungi, are spread by multiple routes,\" said David Blehert, USGS microbiologist and an author of the study. \"This is the reason that in an effort to further control the spread of WNS, resource management agencies have implemented universal precautions, including limiting human access to sensitive environments occupied by bats, decontaminating equipment and clothing moved between these environments, and restricting the movement of equipment between sites.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Insect-eating bats provide economically valuable ecological services that are estimated to save the U.S. agricultural industry alone billions of dollars each year in insect pest-control expenses. However, U.S. bat populations have been declining at an alarming rate since 2006, when white-nose syndrome first appeared in New York State. Since then, the fungus <em>G. destructans<\/em> has spread southward and westward and has now been found in 16 states and 4 Canadian provinces. Bat declines in the Northeast, the most severely affected region in the U.S., thus far have exceeded 80 percent.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This study was conducted by scientists from the USGS, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Tennessee-Knoxville, New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["biology","ecosystems","white Syndrome","fungus","Geomyces Destructans","disease","bats"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1319601600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169017"},{"tid":"170026"},{"tid":"170250"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
