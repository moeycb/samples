Groundwater is also a critical resource for agriculture, energy production, and a vast array of industries.\n\nYet because groundwater is a hidden resource lying below the land surface, it suffers from \u00e2\u0080\u009cout of sight, out of mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d syndrome. People often overlook it, underappreciate it, take it for granted.\n\nUnseen and easily neglected, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no less important. How much groundwater is available in your neighborhood? What quantities of withdrawal by a new industry or a growing number of new neighbors could be sustained? What about the quality of the groundwater?\n\n<strong>USGS Science Making Connections<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"350\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/05_19_2010\/g30Ner5DDx_05_19_2010\/medium\/Public_Wells_03.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" \/> Example of wellhead plumbing typical of public wells sampled in a USGS study of 932 public wells nationwide. About 105 million people\u00e2\u0080\u0094or more than one-third of the Nation's population\u00e2\u0080\u0094receive their drinking water from one of the 140,000 public water systems across the United States that rely on groundwater pumped from public wells. The USGS studies source (untreated) water collected from public wells before treatment or blending, which often are used by public water systems to decrease contaminant concentrations below levels of potential human-health concern. These types of studies assist water utility managers and regulators in making decisions about future monitoring needs and drinking-water issues. Michael Rosen, USGS.[\/caption]\n\nUnderstanding the connections between ground and surface water as part of the hydrologic cycle is crucial to successfully managing water resources. Surface water ends up below the surface as groundwater when rain and collected water seep into the ground. Then groundwater flows within an underground aquifer. Later, it discharges at the surface again to a spring, stream, lake, or other surface water body. USGS scientists, in collaboration with federal, state, and local partners are working to better understand how groundwater flow is affected by population, changes in land use, and ecological demands.\n\nMany USGS studies about groundwater availability are local in scope, simply because local studies are crucial for managing this resource on a local level. However, because local groundwater is interconnected with other components of the hydrologic system, including other parts of aquifers and surface water, it is also important to consider the entire aquifer when assessing groundwater availability.\n\nThe goal of the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/\">Groundwater<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/\">Resources<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/\">Program<\/a> is to document groundwater availability in all of the <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/activities\/regional.html\">major<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/activities\/regional.html\">aquifers<\/a> in the United States. These studies will quantify current aquifer resources, provide a means to evaluate how these resources have changed over time, and provide tools to forecast how much water will be available in the future.\n\nThe USGS develops models to understand the <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwsw.html\">interactions<\/a> between groundwater and surface water. Last year, USGS scientists developed a model for the<a href=\"http:\/\/wa.water.usgs.gov\/news\/2011\/news.sir20115155.htm\">Yakima<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/wa.water.usgs.gov\/news\/2011\/news.sir20115155.htm\">Basin<\/a> in Washington State that will help regulators understand how surface water and groundwater are interconnected.

Once water is pumped out of the aquifer system, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always go back in at the same rate. This means that excess water (runoff) ends up on the surface and ultimately in the ocean. Groundwater development has significantly increased in the past 50 years, and USGS scientists have found that this increase in use has exacerbated the effects of sea level rise.\n\nBecause we depend on high-quality, fresh water \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not only for health, but for many industrial and energy uses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 groundwater availability is also linked to water quality.\u00c2\u00a0 The USGS National Water Quality Program is documenting water quality in the principle aquifers throughout the country while continuing studies to determine which groundwater sources are most vulnerable to contaminants like arsenic, radium, and other trace elements.\n\n<strong>National Groundwater Awareness Week<\/strong>\n\nMarch 11-18, 2012 is the National Groundwater Association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngwa.org%2FEvents-Education%2Fawareness%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3w2RcOjAn5NFCfzL_2TeBoD-Qew\">National<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngwa.org%2FEvents-Education%2Fawareness%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3w2RcOjAn5NFCfzL_2TeBoD-Qew\">Groundwater<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngwa.org%2FEvents-Education%2Fawareness%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3w2RcOjAn5NFCfzL_2TeBoD-Qew\">Awareness<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngwa.org%2FEvents-Education%2Fawareness%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3w2RcOjAn5NFCfzL_2TeBoD-Qew\">Week<\/a>.
