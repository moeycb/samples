Concentrations of three trace metals of concern&mdash;cadmium, lead and zinc&mdash;have been significantly reduced since cleanup activities began in the 1990s.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>From the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> century through 1987, more than 130 million tons of lead, zinc and silver sulfide ores were mined from the Coeur d&rsquo;Alene mining district. Ore processing often included dumping large amounts of metal-rich tailings into and along area streams that then transported those metals downstream.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2004, the USGS, in cooperation with the EPA, established a water-quality monitoring network totaling 18 sites from Mullan to Post Falls, Idaho. USGS hydrologist Greg Clark analyzed water-quality data collected from October 2009 through September 2013. Clark also examined data dating back to the early 1990s to look for any long-term trends. Results of those analyses include:<\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-position: inside;\">\r\n<li>Concentrations of cadmium, lead and zinc have decreased significantly in streams throughout the Coeur d&rsquo;Alene and Spokane River basins since the early 1990s. In the South Fork Coeur d&rsquo;Alene River near Pinehurst, the concentrations of each of the three metals decreased by about 65 percent between 1992 and 2013. In most streams, however, concentrations of cadmium and zinc continue to exceed water-quality criteria established to protect aquatic organisms from toxic exposure to these metals.<\/li>\r\n<li>The rate of decrease in metal concentrations in streams has slowed since 2003. Continued decreases will require a reduction in the contributions of metals to the South Fork Coeur d&rsquo;Alene Rive","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Idaho","Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["","Northern Idaho","Superfund","cleanup","Water Quality","Coeur Alene River","Spokane River","water","Environmental Health"],"distribution":["Environmental Health","Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1416805200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169451"},{"tid":"170410"},{"tid":"170582"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
