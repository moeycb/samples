On October 18, as a part of the Earth Science Week 2013 activities, join leading geoscience organizations in promoting awareness of the importance of geologic mapping to society.<\/p>\n<p>Geologic maps are vital to education, science, business, and public policy concerns. Geologic Map Day will focus the attention of students, teachers, and the general public on the study, uses, and significance of these tools, by engaging audiences through educational activities, print materials, online resources, and public outreach opportunities.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"246\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_09_18\/GeologicMapDay_Sept_2013.jpg\" alt=\"caption is below.\" \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span class=\"small\">Geologic map of the Holy Cross quadrangle, Colorado <\/span><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>In conjunction with Geologic Map Day, the USGS is promoting several new events.&nbsp; The first \"Best Student Geologic Map Competition\" will be held at the annual Geological Society of America meeting.&nbsp; Students in university (either undergraduates or graduate students) from around the world who have completed a geologic map are <a href=\"http:\/\/community.geosociety.org\/2013AnnualMeeting\/Conference\/StudentInfo\/MapCompetition\">eligible to compete<\/a> and we will be posting short videos of university students who have mapping in the field this summer.&nbsp; We hope these videos will inspire younger students in high school to consider the Earth Sciences as their future major.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Be sure to check out the Geologic Map Day poster included in this year's Earth Science Week <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthsciweek.org\/materials\/\">Toolkit<\/a>. The poster and other materials in the kit show how geologic maps can be used to understand natural hazards as well as providing step-by-step instructions for a related classroom activity.
