The average streamflow for several key sites in July 2000 ranged from 92 to 240 percent of the long-term average discharge for July. <\/p>\n<p>The average streamflow into the Chesapeake Bay during July 2000 was 22 billion gallons per day, which is about the long-term average for July and 2.6 times greater than July 1999. Together, the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers at their outlets discharged 10.3 and 4.0 billion gallons per day, respectively, which provided 65 percent of the total streamflow discharging to the Chesapeake Bay during July 2000. Streamflow during July at the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., averaged 2.8 billion gallons per day, which is about normal for July. Throughout most of Maryland, streamflow decreased during July, but remained within the normal range. Streamflow increased on the Eastern Shore and in Delaware in July, and moved from within the normal range to above the normal range. <\/p>\r\n<p>Ground-water levels at the end of July decreased throughout the area but generally remained in the normal to above-normal range throughout the entire bistate area.
