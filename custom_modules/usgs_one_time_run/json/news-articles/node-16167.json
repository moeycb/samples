A new study by the U.S. Geological Survey is using a low-flying plane to measure the magnetic field of the earth, which may help map and characterize shallow concealed faults associated with the New Madrid Seismic Zone.\n\n<strong>It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bird!

The airborne magnetic survey is just one of many USGS efforts, such as subsurface seismic and radar imaging, trenching into earthquake-generated sand blows and faults, and estimating ground shaking in future earthquakes, to better understand the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Results from these studies help citizens, engineers, emergency managers, and public officials understand the hazard so that they can take actions that will reduce losses in future earthquakes.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_181523\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"526\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/NMseismicity-for-TopStory1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-181523   \" title=\"NMseismicity for TopStory\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/NMseismicity-for-TopStory1-927x1024.jpg\" alt=\"This map shows the study area within the New Madrid Seismic Zone.

Though no knowledge of an imminent large earthquake exists, the USGS has serious concerns about the potential repeat of a destructive earthquake in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, like the remarkable earthquake sequence that occurred in the winter of 1811\u00e2\u0080\u00931812. This sequence of earthquakes was felt 800 to 1000 miles away along the Eastern Seaboard. President\u00c2\u00a0James Madison felt these earthquakes in Washington D.C., and wrote about the shaking he felt in a letter to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nGeologic evidence from sand blows shows that sequences of large earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 7 to 8 also occurred in this region in about 1450 A.D., 900 A.D., and 2300 B.C. The geologic evidence indicates that these earthquakes were large with strong aftershocks that produced prolonged and severe ground motions in the area that is now home to several million people.\n\n<strong>Similar risk exists today <\/strong>\n\nA repeat of the 1811\u00e2\u0080\u00931812 earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone today threatens northern Alabama, northeastern Arkansas, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, western Kentucky, northern Mississippi, southeastern Missouri, and western Tennessee. Recent USGS projections place the likelihood of a magnitude 6 or higher earthquake at about 25 to 50 percent over the next 50 years, and the likelihood of a magnitude 7 or higher earthquake at 10 percent.\n\nWith large cities such as Memphis, St. Louis, Little Rock, and Nashville experiencing strong shaking from a large-scale New Madrid earthquake, understanding earthquake hazards helps communities prepare for them, thereby reducing losses and speeding recovery.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_181611\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"524\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/cartoon_with_logo1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-181611   \" title=\"cartoon_with_logo\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/cartoon_with_logo1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Faults sometimes bring together rocks with different magnetic properties.

Anyone observing the low-flying, red and white single-engine Cessna airplane should not be alarmed if they see it fly overhead or pass below the horizon. The airplane is operated by experienced pilots who are specially trained for low-level flying. The magnetometer on the airplane measures the magnetic field of the earth without emitting any energy or signal of its own.\n\nAlso, USGS scientists stick to their specialties\u00e2\u0080\u0094you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find them flying the plane!

It will require several months to a year before results from the survey are released. Stay tuned to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">USGS website<\/a> for new developments!
