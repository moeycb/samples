And it helps maintain a variety of aquatic ecosystems that are dependent on groundwater discharge to streams, lakes, and wetlands.\n\nGroundwater is a part of our daily lives.\u00c2\u00a0 Rural farmers and urbanites, water-supply managers and regulators, researchers and policy-makers all have a part to play in the current status and future of our groundwater resources.\u00c2\u00a0 This valuable resource is right underneath our feet.\n\n<strong>Groundwater Challenges<\/strong>\n\nThe USGS strives to understand the dynamics of the many demands for groundwater from both human and environmental uses.\u00c2\u00a0 Understanding these dynamics helps answer important questions about current groundwater availability and long-term sustainability.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"373\"]<img src=\"http:\/\/ga.water.usgs.gov\/edu\/pictures\/irrigation.jpg\" alt=\"A picture showing farmland in Idaho being irrigated by a large spray-irrigation system. \" width=\"373\" height=\"259\" \/> In many states, groundwater is a vital source of irrigation water for farmers.[\/caption]\n\nGroundwater is everywhere, but its availability varies. Groundwater availability can be compared to a bank account.\u00c2\u00a0 An underground aquifer, a resource shared by many users, receives deposits from precipitation and surface water. The many users make withdrawals from the aquifer to\u00c2\u00a0irrigate farmlands or supply wells.\u00c2\u00a0 If there are too many withdrawals, and not enough steady deposits, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough groundwater in the aquifer to go around.\n\nEven when water is plentiful, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not truly available unless the quality is acceptable for the intended use.\u00c2\u00a0 Both water quantity and quality are essential to maintaining water supply for municipal, domestic, agricultural, and recreational use and for aquatic ecosystems.\n\n<strong>Quantity Assessments<\/strong>\n\nThe USGS has a legacy of groundwater assessment, publishing the first national assessment of groundwater in the early 1900s.\u00c2\u00a0 The USGS is working toward determining water availability in 30-40 major aquifers\u00c2\u00a0as part of a national water census.\u00c2\u00a0 These <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/activities\/gw-avail.html\">aquifer assessments<\/a> provide objective scientific information about the effects of human activities on water levels, groundwater storage, and discharge to surface-water bodies and explore how climate variability could affect groundwater availability.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"480\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/ogw\/gwrp\/activities\/images\/USGS-regional-groundwater-studies-2013-Jan.jpg\" alt=\"A graphic showing various USGS regional groundwater studies, color-coded by the fiscal year in which they either took place, are taking place, or will take place.\" width=\"480\" height=\"334\" \/> Various regional USGS groundwater studies either complete, planned or in progress[\/caption]\n\nMany states are experiencing groundwater decline in places where withdrawals have increased largely in response to economic and population growth.\u00c2\u00a0 Many regions in states such as Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Louisiana, Texas and Illinois have experienced lowered groundwater levels by as much as several hundred feet.\u00c2\u00a0 In other locations, increased withdrawals have caused saline groundwater to encroach inland.\u00c2\u00a0 Extensive groundwater pumping has resulted in land-surface subsidence and sinkholes.\u00c2\u00a0 The USGS has recently released a <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1376\/\">scientific study<\/a> illustrating\u00c2\u00a0 how increased groundwater withdrawals can result in streamflow depletion.\u00c2\u00a0 The stress of increased demands on groundwater resources \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for domestic supply, municipal supply, irrigation and industrial uses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 has decreased availability in some areas.\n\n<strong>Quality Assessments<\/strong>\n\nIn parallel, USGS groundwater quality assessments assist water-quality managers and regulators in making decisions about monitoring needs and drinking water issues.\u00c2\u00a0 The USGS collaborates with other federal, state, and local drinking water programs to conduct extensive monitoring for regulatory and compliance purposes.\u00c2\u00a0 The whole of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groundwater can be divided into 62 principal aquifers; these provide one-third of the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population their drinking water from public supply systems and 15 percent of the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population with drinking water \u00c2\u00a0from private domestic wells.\u00c2\u00a0 Each aquifer can cover multiple states, yet management decisions are made on the local level.\u00c2\u00a0 USGS groundwater quality assessments provide that large-scale perspective on each aquifer, providing consistent information needed by decision-makers.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176162\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"368\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Groundwater-Recharge-Station.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-176162  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Groundwater-Recharge-Station-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"An image showing water cascading down an aerator at an aquifer storage and recovery plant\" width=\"368\" height=\"247\" \/><\/a> Cascading aerator at aquifer storage and recovery plant (credit: Cassi L.
