No homeowner wants to be flooded out, and lake-based businesses such as marinas don&#39;t want to be left high and dry,&quot; said USGS scientist Douglas Wilcox, who led this study. &quot;Yet maintaining a vibrant ecosystem is important since that is what brings people here in the first place. &nbsp; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Great Lakes Basin contains 95 percent of the fresh surface water in North America and 18 percent of the fresh surface water in the world. &quot;It was important and logical that we start with this region in looking at the availability of fresh water, a resource that is crucial to the nation&#39;s economy and ecosystems. This report is intended to give planners and policy-makers the information they need to strike a balance between these needs and achieve long-term economic and ecosystem health for this region,&quot; said Wilcox. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe report describes both recorded changes in water levels and pre-historical changes that were reconstructed from scientific data. Currently, reconstructed water-level histories have been completed for Lakes Michigan and Huron going back 4,700 years. &nbsp;Other lakes in the Great Lakes basin will be completed in the future. &nbsp;Water-level recording began in the 1840s, and systematic records from all lakes began in 1860.&nbsp; The current network of gages has been in operation on each lake since 1918. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAmong the findings noted in this report: \r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Regulation of lake levels has created problems for wetlands of Lakes Superior and Ontario.&nbsp; Periodic high lake levels are needed to kill trees, shrubs, and canopy-dominating emergent plants in Great Lakes wetlands. Low water levels are needed to promote seed germination and growth of a multitude of species.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The effects of regulation have been most severe in Lake Ontario, where the natural pattern of high and low lake levels has largely been eliminated by regulation at Niagara Falls.&nbsp; As a result, extensive stands of cattails have become established in nearly all wetlands along Lake Ontario.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York","Pennsylvania","Indiana","Iowa","Michigan","Minnesota","Ohio","Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1182312000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169294"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
