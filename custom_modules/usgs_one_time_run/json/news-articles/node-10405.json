Between individual ice age events, the Earth&rsquo;s sea level has varied as much as almost 200 meters [660 feet]&quot; said USGS geologist Richard S. Williams, Jr., senior editor of the atlas series. &quot;The impact of even small amounts of sea-level change in low-lying coastal areas, where most humans live, may be significant. This global baseline study is necessary to assess worldwide changes in glaciers and potential accompanying changes in sea level over the next few decades.&quot; \r\n<p>\r\nA comprehensive baseline of the Earth&rsquo;s glaciers during the 1970s will result from the atlas series, &quot;Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World.&quot; This series represents an international project that is coordinated by the USGS. The project compares up-to-date field information about the glaciers and historical data with optimum Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images to determine changes in the Earth&rsquo;s glaciers. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUntil recently, studying the extent of Greenland glaciers has been difficult. Uniform aerial photography of the entire coastal region was only achieved in 1987. Compilation of maps using geodetic satellite positioning techniques to accurately determine geographical positions of the northern parts of the island is progressing. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe great areal extent of the Inland Ice makes it difficult to observe and study the ice sheet in its entirety. Estimates of ice-covered and ice-free areas, based on a newly compiled map of Greenland, are presented in this atlas. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEach Landsat image covers about 35,000 square kilometers (13,500 square miles), almost the combined areas of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Landsat images were used to outline areas of ablation and accumulation of the outer parts of the Inland Ice and determine if the ice is growing or receding. Preliminary results reported in the new atlas indicate that the Inland Ice is in equilibrium, neither growing nor receding. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Inland Ice, Northern Hemisphere&rsquo;s largest remnant of the Earth&rsquo;s most recent ice age, is 1,736,095 square kilometers (670,272 square miles, or more than the combined areas of Alaska and Oregon) and covers about 80 percent of Greenland. In addition, approximately 48,599 square kilometers (18,763 square miles, or more than the combined areas of Vermont and New Hampshire) of Greenland are covered by smaller, local ice caps and glaciers. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe satellite-image atlas of Greenland is the fifth in an 11-volume series, &quot;Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World,&quot; being produced by the USGS. Editors of the volume are USGS scientists Richard S. Williams, Jr. and Jane G. Ferrigno. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe 141-page Greenland chapter was written by Anker Weidick of the Geological Survey of Greenland and includes a section on Landsat images of Greenland by Williams and Ferrigno.
