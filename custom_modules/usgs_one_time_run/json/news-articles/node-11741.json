Work in the Cascades will emphasize three areas. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>First, CVO will reorganize telemetry networks into a &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; telemetry system for the Cascade Range volcanoes, stretching from northern California to Washington. &nbsp;This will improve quality and quantity of monitoring data coming to the observatory, provide for resiliency of the system and allow future expansion of monitoring networks. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Second, CVO will acquire airborne Light Detection and Ranging Images, essentially high- precision laser-generated digital topographic maps, of the most dangerous volcanoes in the Cascades and their out-flowing drainages. Such maps are needed to accurately forecast paths of volcanic mudflows that can occur at any time, as well as lava and pyroclastic flows. &nbsp;They also can assist in geological mapping efforts, and provide a baseline for measuring changes in a volcano when an eruption occurs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Third, CVO will work with partners to develop state-of-the-art multi-hazard risk and vulnerability assessments to aid in community planning and eruption response.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Work to be conducted with ARRA funds is divided into six projects, coinciding with the six high-risk volcanic areas in the United States. These allocations are $950,000 for the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, $7.56 million for the Alaska Volcano Observatory, $2.4 million for the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington state, $3.3 million for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, $200,000 for the Long Valley Observatory in California and $800,000 for upgrading networks in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.<\/p>\r\n<p>The funds for all of the observatories will support universities and local government agencies as scientific partners in volcano observatory activities, as well as private sector companies that manufacture scientific instruments, provide aviation services, and supply computer expertise<\/p>\r\n<p>The United States and its territories contain 169 volcanoes considered capable of erupting.&nbsp; One, Kilauea in Hawaii, has been erupting continuously for the past 26 years, at times inundating residential areas with lava and at other times requiring national park closures due to explosions and toxic gas.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Another, Redoubt Volcano in Alaska, shot ash clouds to heights of more than 50,000 feet several times this year.&nbsp; The three-month long eruption appears to have paused and may have ended, but not before severely disrupting aviation operations, repeatedly dusting Alaskan communities with ash, and forcing an oil storage facility to suspend operations.<\/","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Oregon","Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["volcano","Mt","St","Helens","Northwest"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1250136000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169120"},{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
