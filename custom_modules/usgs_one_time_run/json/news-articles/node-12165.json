A new maximum streamflow of 7,560 cubic feet per second was set at the Sheyenne River near Warwick, N.D. on April 11, breaking the previous peak of 4,930 cubic feet per second set during the 2009 flood. Also, a new maximum streamflow of 7,000 cubic feet per second was set at the Sheyenne River below Baldhill Dam on April 13.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since early April, six USGS hydrographers have been servicing the 25 streamgages in the Sheyenne River Basin and measuring streamflow and water levels at all stations,&rdquo; said Gregg Wiche, director of the USGS North Dakota Water Science Center. &ldquo;The USGS data are used by various National, State, and local agencies for flood forecasts, the operation of dams, the design of levees, and decision making.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS collects data from more than 100 streamgages in North Dakota, most of which provide real-time data that is transmitted every hour.
