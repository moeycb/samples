In this integrated 3D approach geologists, geophysicists and modelers work closely together to map geologic units and structure. The result is a quantitative, visually intuitive 3D map, well suited for process modeling applications such as earthquake hazards and contaminant transport.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Sunday, 10\/18, 8:50 AM, B110\/111\/112<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Lessons learned from the 1959 Hebgen Lake Earthquake<\/strong><br \/>David P. Schwartz<br \/>Paper 14-4\/Oral Presentation<\/p>\r\n<p>The magnitude 7.3 Hebgen Lake, Montana earthquake was one of the largest in the U.S. during the 20th century, rupturing two regional faults and displacing geomorphic features at several sites. Scientists studying the area have uncovered evidence of several previous large earthquakes on both of these faults. Earth scientists should not assume that a simple earthquake scarp represents a single paleoearthquake.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Sunday, 10\/18, 8:50 AM, D135\/136<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Experimental Results of Carbon Sequestration in Basaltic Rocks<\/strong><br \/>Robert Rosenbauer<br \/>Paper 22-4\/Oral Presentation<\/p>\r\n<p>Basaltic volcanic rocks have potential as reservoirs for carbon dioxide sequestration because of their high capacity for mineral trapping of CO2 in the form of carbonate minerals such as magnesite, siderite, and calcite.
