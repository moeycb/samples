Of the oil and gas endowment of about 5.6 trillion barrels of oil, USGS estimates that the world has consumed about 18 percent, leaving about 82 percent to be used or found. USGS scientist Thomas Ahlbrandt will discuss frontiers in fossil fuel exploration, nonconventional oil and gas, alternatives to oil and gas, and time frames for potential shortfalls. <b>&quot;Future Oil and Gas Resources of the World: A Coming Supply Crisis?,&quot;<\/b> in Session U32A, is scheduled for 1:50 pm on Wednesday, May 29, Washington Convention Center Room 30. <b>Please note: A news conference on this session is scheduled for 9:00 am on Wednesday, May 29 in the Press Briefing Room, Washington Convention Center Room 1.<\/b> Digital products from the World Energy Project may be downloaded at: <a href=\"http:\/\/energy.cr.usgs.gov\/energy\/WorldEnergy\/WEnergy.html\">http:\/\/energy.cr.usgs.gov\/energy\/WorldEnergy\/WEnergy.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Vanishing Glaciers -- New Alliances or More Conflict in Central Asia?:<\/b> Throughout the world, glaciers are shrinking. Some of the fastest retreat is in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region, where scientists expect that more than 15,000 square miles of glaciers will disappear during the 21st century, particularly in major valleys and low mountain passes. Glaciers supply much of the fresh water and hydroelectric power in South and Central Asia. Will shared economic interests in water, hydroelectricity, and the mitigation of flood hazards improve relations among Central and South Asian nations? Will the disappearance of this natural barrier open new corridors for trade and cultural exchange and forge new economic, military and political alliances in the region, or will it simply open transit routes for militants and for military offensive action? Will terrorists find it harder to hide but easier to move? Glaciers are relevant to the conflict in Kashmir, to security in Afghanistan, and to the current insurgency in Nepal. USGS scientist Jeffrey Kargel will discuss a joint USGS\/NASA Pathfinder project and its global consortium of glaciologists who are using satellite remote sensing to map and monitor the HKH glaciers and other glaciers throughout the world. <b>&quot;Glaciers in 21st Century Himalayan Geopolitics,&quot;<\/b> in Session U22A, is scheduled for 3:25 pm on Tuesday, May 28, Washington Convention Center Room 30. <b>Please note: A news conference on this session is scheduled for 9:00 am on Tuesday, May 28 in the Press Briefing Room, Washington Convention Center Room 1.<\/b> For more on the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS), please see: <a href=\"http:\/\/wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov\/GLIMS\/\">http:\/\/wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov\/GLIMS\/<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>More on Vanishing Glaciers:<\/b> As glaciers retreat, new land uses become possible: Transportation corridors may open; previously inaccessible energy and mineral resources may become available; new wildlife habitat and migration routes may develop, and for a time, more fresh water and hydropower will be available. In Alaska, more than 7,700 square miles of land are expected to emerge from beneath ice over the next century, producing a potential economic windfall estimated at $360 million per year. In western China, the economic development and well-being of the populace is partly dependent on melting glaciers. In India, melting glaciers and snowfields account for about $4 billion per year of hydroelectric power (at $0.03\/kW-hr), more than $400 million of which results from the net loss of glacial mass that the region is currently experiencing. What about the future? The rapid retreat of Hindu Kush-Himalaya glaciers will eventually result in more water shortages in a region where clean water alr","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1022558400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
