However, unlike Fran flooding, floods caused by Floyd in the upper Neuse and upper Cape Fear River Basins were at the 2- to 10-year recurrence intervals. Following Hurricane Fran, many of these same streams had floods exceeding the 100-year recurrence interval. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Recent flooding actually resulted from high rainfall associated with Hurricanes Dennis (Sept. 4-6) and Floyd (Sept. 14-16). For example, rainfall at Clayton was 5.0 inches during Sept. 4-6 and 7.33 inches during Sept. 14-16. At Whiteville, rainfall was 1.51 inches during Sept. 4-6 and 16.76 inches during Sept. 14-16. Rocky Mount received 7.02 inches during Sept. 4-6 and 16.18 inches during Sept. 14-16, or nearly half the annual average rainfall in just two 3-day periods. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS operates more than 200 stream-gaging stations in North Carolina.
