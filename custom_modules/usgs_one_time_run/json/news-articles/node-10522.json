The maps generally reinforce and confirm information provided in Environmentally Critical Areas maps currently used by the City of Seattle. <\/p>\r\n<p>Several USGS maps and reports related to landslide hazards in Seattle are available online at <a href=\"http:\/\/landslides.usgs.gov\/learningeducation\/publications.php\">http:\/\/landslides.usgs.gov\/learningeducation\/publications.php<\/a>.
