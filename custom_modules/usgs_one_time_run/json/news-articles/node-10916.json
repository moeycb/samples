The extended continental shelf, the seafloor and subsoil beyond 200 nautical miles from shore that meet those criteria, is an area of great scientific interest and potential economic development.<\/p>\r\n<p>The expedition will be collaboratively undertaken by the U.S. and Canada using two ships. The U.S. Geological Survey will lead data collection from September 6-October 1 on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter <span class=\"italics\">Healy <\/span>to map the Arctic seafloor. The Geological Survey of Canada, Natural Resources Canada will follow <span class=\"italics\">Healy <\/span>on the Canadian Coast Guard ship <span class=\"italics\">Louis S. St. Laurent (Louis)<\/span> and study the geology of the sub-seafloor.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The two-ship experiment allows both the U.S. and Canada to collect and share complementary data in areas where data acquisition is costly, logistically difficult, and sometimes dangerous,\" said USGS scientist Deborah Hutchinson, who will sail aboard <span class=\"italics\">Louis<\/span>. \"Both countries benefit through sharing of resources and data as well as increasing likelihood of success by utilizing two ice-breaker ships in these remote areas of the Arctic Ocean.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>\"<span class=\"italics\">Healy <\/span>will utilize an echo sounder, which emits sounds signals in the water, to map the seafloor. This will be done using a multibeam bathymetry system,\" said USGS scientist Jonathan Childs, chief scientist on <span class=\"italics\">Healy <\/span>during the September cruise. \"Unlike conventional echo sounders, which measure the water depth at a point directly beneath the ship, the multibeam system collects a &lsquo;swath&lsquo; of depth information about 3 km wide along the ship's path, creating a three-dimensional view of the seafloor.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funded U.S. participation in the U.S.-Canadian mission and collaborated with the University of New Hampshire to collect bathymetric data in the Arctic Ocean on Healy from August 14-September 5.<\/p>\r\n<p>Research is coordinated by the Extended Continental Shelf Task Force, a government-wide group headed by the U.S. Department of State. Participants in this Task Force include the USGS, NOAA, U.S. Coast Guard, National Science Foundation, Joint Chiefs of   Staff, U.S. Navy, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, Executive Office of the President, Minerals Management Service, and the Arctic Research Commission.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information about the Convention on the Law of the Sea, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.un.org\/Depts\/los\/index.htm\">http:\/\/www.un.org\/Depts\/los\/index.htm<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alaska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","marine","seafloor","blog","Arctic","Mapping"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1220328000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169761"},{"tid":"169633"},{"tid":"170119"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
