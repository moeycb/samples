Current data reveal coherent, continental- to regional-scale patterns that depend on underlying soil parent materials, soil age, land type\/land use, and climate. Human-induced modifications to soil geochemistry related to current and historic industrial and agricultural activities are recognized by comparing element concentrations in surface soils to deeper soils at individual sites. However, regional enrichments of some metals of environmental concern resulting from mineralization by natural geologic process can be as high (or even higher) than enrichments from anthropogenic contamination.<\/p>\r\n<div>\r\n<hr width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" \/>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2:10 p.m., Room 205CD<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Mysterious Fossils from the Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater and Beyond<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Lucy E. Edwards<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>The largest known impact crater in the U.S. lies buried beneath the Virginia Coastal Plain. The late Eocene Chesapeake Bay impact event caused a wide variety of distinctive features, such as fossil algae (dinocysts) that were found in drilled cores from hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface. The study of distinctive preservational features, whether related to the crater or not, leads to more questions than answers. How was a specific feature formed? How did it come to be preserved in the fossil record?<\/p>\r\n<div>\r\n<hr width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" \/>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">5:15 p.m., Room M100FG<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Examining the Spread of the Deadly White Nose Syndrome in Bats <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Christopher Swezey and Christopher Garrity <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>WNS causes dramatic and unusual mortality among bat colonies, and it has recently spread across the eastern part of North America. The spread is of great concern because bats play important roles in insect population control, plant pollination, and seed dissemination. Research shows that the spread of WNS may be inhibited in caves with air temperatures above 68 degrees F, a condition that occurs near the southern border of the continental U.S. Spread may also be inhibited by conditions of low humidity, but a specific threshold has not yet been identified.<\/p>\r\n<div>\r\n<hr width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" \/>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">9 a.m. &ndash; 6 p.m. poster session, &nbsp;Hall C, Booth 22<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Historic Signs of Contamina","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["","Minnesota","geology"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1318046400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169491"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
