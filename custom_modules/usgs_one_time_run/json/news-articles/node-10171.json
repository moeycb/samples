Moreover, the effects of long-term exposure to pesticide mixtures are, as yet, unknown.\" \r\n<p>Furthermore, ground water in agricultural areas downstream from Denver is less of an option as a rural drinking-water supply because of the impacts to ground-water quality from the intensive application of agricultural fertilizers and manure, accompanied by widespread irrigation,\" Dennehy said. \"We found that nitrate concentrations exceeded the maximum contaminant level, or MCL, in about 48 percent of agricultural wells sampled. A maximum contaminant level is a drinking-water regulatory standard that is set by the USEPA. Although the wells sampled for this study were not drinking-water wells, local residents get their drinking water from domestic wells that tap the same underground water-supply source,\" Dennehy said. \r\n<p>Surface- and ground-water resources in the Denver metropolitan area are susceptible to contamination from pesticides and VOCs. All surface-water samples collected at two urban sites contained at least one pesticide, and water from 90 percent of the wells in the shallow alluvial aquifer contained at ]east one pesticide. VOCs were detected in 86 percent of the wells sampled from the shallow alluvial aquifen Sixty- two percent of the samples had more than one VOC present. \r\n<p>The most frequently detected VOC was methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive used to reduce carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles during winter. Although pesticide and VOC concentrations generally were small, their widespread occurrence is a concern, Currently, neither surface nor ground water from the urban area is used for drinking water, but better management of potentially toxic substances may be needed to protect water resources for possible future use as a drinking-water supply. \r\n<p>The good news from the USGS report is that surface and ground water in the forested mountain areas are generally of good quality and relatively unaffected by humans. Mining activities and residential development, however, have impacted water resources and fish communities. Wells are the primary.drinking-water source for most mountain communities, but pesticides were not detected in well water, and only one well had a nitrate concentration above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standard. \r\n<p>VOCs, such as gasoline components and cleaning solvents were detected in 30 percent of the wells sampled in the mountain areas, but none of the concentrations exceeded drinking-water standards. The occurrence of VOCs in mountain wells indicates that ground water is susceptible to contamination from development and other human activities on the surface. \r\n<p>The effects of human activity on water quality go beyond the concerns of drinking water--the aquatic ecosystem of the basin also has been affected. \"Surface water from agricultural and urban areas is not used for drinking water, but fish and invertebrate communities that live in these waters are affected by degraded stream-water-quality,\" Dennehy said. \"Although variability in the type and number of fi","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Colorado"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"893044800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169869"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
