The dye will be released at various locations which lie to the north of Mexico Avenue and to the west of Buckley Road, and monitored at downstream locations by USGS hydrologists.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe study will provide estimates of the time it takes for water in the creek to flow through Aurora. These estimates can be used to understand the movement of contaminants that can be introduced to the stream either by design or as the result of an accidental spill. The study is part of ongoing work by the USGS and the City of Aurora.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nInformation on USGS studies of water resources in Colorado is available at the <a href=\"http:\/\/co.water.usgs.gov\/\">Colorado Water Science Center<\/a> Web site.\r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Colorado"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1183953600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169491"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
