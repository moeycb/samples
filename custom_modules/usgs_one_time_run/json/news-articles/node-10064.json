Philosophers enlarge the discussion of the \"good life\" to include a sense of community and responsibility. Turner has a Ph.D. in Geology from the University of Colorado and has worked as a USGS Research Geologist in Denver, Colo. for 24 years. Her specialty is integrated studies of sedimentary basins, and reconstruction of extinct ecosystems. \r\n<p><b>For an interview anytime between October 25 - 29, contact:<\/b><br>GSA Newsroom<br>416\/585-3706 or 416\/585-3707<br>\r\n<p><b>For additional information after October 29, contact:<br><\/b>Christine Turner<br>303\/236-1561<br>cturner@usgs.gov<br><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"909464400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
