They include:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Providing information for effective management of the Red River Basin in light of climate-driven changes to flows. A Chickasaw Nation scientist leads this project. In addition, another project led by USGS will provide resource managers with the information they need to understand the nexus among climate change effects on stream flow, water, quality and stream ecology for watersheds in the Arkansas-Red River Basin. &nbsp;Both projects will help managers strengthen strategies that support restoration, conservation and management goals. <\/li>\r\n<li>Assessing future water availability (distribution, quantity and demand) in the south-central region in response to the area&rsquo;s already changing climate.<\/li>\r\n<li>Evaluating the ecological implications and the drivers of climate change in coastal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico, an area of huge economic and ecological importance. <\/li>\r\n<li>Working with other partners to better understand the impacts of extreme climatic events (e.g., tornadoes) and other climate drivers on agriculture, water availability and quality, cultural resources and fish and wildlife. This information will be invaluable for public and private sector managers and decision makers facing climate adaptation challenges.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>\"It is a privilege for me to work with the many tribes, state and federal agencies to build these multi-discipline research teams to develop the science needed for them to generate adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect cultural and natural resources,&rdquo; said Kim Winton, director of the South Central Climate Science Center. &ldquo;There are many physical, biological and social science components to climate change, and the South Central Climate Science Center is the forum that brings together these sciences and scientists.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Each of the Department of the Interior's eight&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/csc\/\">Climate Science Centers<\/a> worked with states, tribes, federal agencies, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/landscape-conservation\/lcc.html\">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives<\/a>, universities supporting the CSCs, and other regional partners to identify the highest priority management challenges in need of scientific input, and to solicit and select research projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>The studies will be undertaken by teams of scientists from the universities that comprise the South Central CSC, from USGS science centers, and from other partners such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USDA Forest Service, Indian tribes, and the&nbsp;Landscape Conservation Cooperatives in each region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The eight <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/CSC_consortia_and_regions.pdf\">DOI Climate Science Centers<\/a","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New Mexico","Oklahoma","Texas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["ecosystems","Climate Change","climate","","Climate Science","","Texas","New Mexico","Oklahoma"],"distribution":["Climate Change"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1387429200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169876"},{"tid":"170026"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
