This product provides opportunities to better understand the timing and causes of wetland loss, which are critical for forecasting landscape changes in the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS map can be used to help inform land managers on ways to manage this national treasure to become a more resilient ecosystem. Coastal Louisiana wetlands support the largest commercial fishery in the lower 48 states and provide critical habitat to many threatened and endangered species. The delta is the seventh largest on Earth and the wetlands help to buffer populations and property from hurricanes and other storms.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>What: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>USGS Louisiana Wetlands Land Area Change Map unveiling <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Phil Turnipseed, USGS National Wetlands Research Center Director <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Louisiana State Capitol<br \/> House Committee Room 3<br \/> Baton Rouge, La.   <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>1 p.m.<br \/> Thursday, June 2, 2011<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<h3><strong>*Aerial or boat tours of wetland areas may be arranged*<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>Space is limited.
