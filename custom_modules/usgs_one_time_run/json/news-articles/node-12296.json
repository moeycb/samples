These new large vessels are floating scientific laboratories, enabling USGS researchers to explore the health and population of biological organisms in lakes Erie and Ontario. Such research is used by federal, state, and tribal resource managers to protect the area's $7 billion annual commercial and sport fisheries.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHAT: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Dedication and Delivery Ceremony for New USGS Research Vessels Kaho and Muskie  <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHO:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Anne Castle, U.S. Department of the Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science<br \/> Marcia McNutt, USGS Director<br \/> Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson<br \/> Joseph P.
