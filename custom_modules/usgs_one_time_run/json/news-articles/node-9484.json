{"title":"Free Maps For Wraps Continues At USGS","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>They really do &quot;give a wrap&quot; at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. In fact they are giving away outdated topographical maps that can be used for holiday gift wrap, just for visiting the agency&rsquo;s map sales outlet at 345 Middlefield Road in Menlo Park, between now and December 22. <\/p>\n<p>The maps that the USGS is giving away are outdated maps that otherwise would have to be sent a landfill. &quot;This is our way of recycling them,&quot; said Mara Tongue, chief of the USGS map sales outlet. Because most of the maps have areas of green that represent vegetation and shades of red that depict urban areas, they even incorporate the traditional holiday colors. <\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to the outdated but free maps, the USGS also has hundreds of up-to-date maps and colorful posters that make great, inexpensive gifts. The standard topographical maps that are used by hikers, fishermen and other outdoor enthusiasts, are $4 each and larger poster-type wall maps are priced $7-$10 each. <\/p>\r\n<p>The free maps are available by visiting the USGS Earth Science Information Center (map sales) from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, and until 7 p.m. on Thursday, December 13, on the main floor of Building 3 of the USGS center at 345 Middlefield Road in Menlo Park. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1007614800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"},{"tid":"169240"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
