The instantaneous data has been available for many years, but was not accessible through the web.&nbsp; This new database saves time and effort by giving users the information through a user-friendly automated process. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;A user-friendly archive of historical instantaneous streamflow data are important to many different users for such things as floodplain mapping, flood modeling, and estimating pollutant transport..&quot; said Robert Hirsch, USGS Associate Director of Water. &quot;The new IDA site should be very helpful to research scientists and engineers for a wide range of hydrologic analyses.&nbsp; We are delighted that we have the ability to provide this treasure trove of high-quality data for these uses.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe IDA web site currently has about 1.5 billion instantaneous data values from 5,500 streamgages in 26 states. Populating this web site takes effort and resources that are being provided &quot;as available,&quot; and not all states and streamgages are available at this time. The number of states and streamgages with data will continue to increase. It is possible that the IDA database will expand to include other variables such as temperature and pH in the future. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in streams and rivers across the U.S. The USGS collects data from more than 7,400 streamgages, many of which provide real-time data in 15 minute increments (explore this information at the <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/\">USGS WaterWatch Web site<\/a>. USGS streamflow data is routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, water availability and quality planning, and for many recreational activities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccess an even larger variety of USGS data, such as for ground water and water quality, through the <a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/\">National Water Information System Web Interface (NWISWeb)<\/a>, which contains over 1.5 million sites, and averages over 25 million successful visits per month. \r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1195016400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169606"},{"tid":"170477"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
