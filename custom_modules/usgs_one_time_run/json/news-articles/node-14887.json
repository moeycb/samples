These maps show where flooding would occur at various high river levels. They are just one example of U.S. Geological Survey products and services developed in the 100 years since Ohio&rsquo;s devastating Great Flood of 1913.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The 100-year anniversary of the Great Flood of 1913 falls during the 2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.srh.noaa.gov\/bmx\/?n=outreach_fsaw2013\">Flood Safety Awareness Week<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS prepared the new maps to help emergency managers and the public make more informed decisions when flooding is forecast. Flood inundation maps are connected to real-time river levels at USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/rt\">streamgages<\/a> to help communities identify immediate risks during a flood. Since the historic flood of March 23-27, 1913, which caused more than 400 deaths and $300 million in damages throughout the Ohio River Valley, the USGS has developed streamgage networks and tools to better support flood preparedness and provide flood warnings.<\/p>\r\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"263\" width=\"350\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/HDnBJlmv3o0?rel=0\"><\/iframe><\/div>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The 1913 statewide flood is Ohio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Greatest Natural Disaster&rsquo;.
