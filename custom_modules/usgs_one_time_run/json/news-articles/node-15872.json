A new study published in the journal, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nature11014.html\"><em>Nature<\/em><\/a>, suggests that most field experiments may underestimate the degree to which the timing of leafing and flowering changes with global warming.\n\nUnderstanding how plants are responding to climate change will help develop more accurate indicators of spring, forecast the onset of allergy season or the chances of western wildfires, manage wildlife and invasive plants, and help inform habitat restoration plans.\n\nIn this new study, scientists evaluated the sensitivity of plants to changes in temperature using two sources: experimental plots versus historical observations from natural sites.\n\nThe experiments analyzed in this study were conducted by artificially inducing warming in small study plots, and then measuring plant responses. The historical observations entailed long-term monitoring of multiple species at natural ecological research sites without any manipulation. The date of leafing and flowering was synthesized for dozens of warming experiments and monitoring sites across the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nScientists conclude that compared to warming experiments, historical monitoring shows temperature sensitivity to be four times greater for leafing and over eight times faster for flowering.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"290\" caption=\"Recording how climatic variations and trends impact seasonal events in plants.

The finding was strikingly consistent across species and datasets. Conclusions from this study are based on analysis of more than 1600 plant species on four continents.\n\nThe study of how climatic variations and trends impact seasonal events in plants and animals is termed \u00e2\u0080\u009cphenology.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This includes when cherry trees or lilacs blossom, when robins build their nests, when salmon swim upstream to spawn, or when leaves turn colors in the fall.\n\nThe study was conducted by an interdisciplinary team led by Elizabeth Wolkovich, with the University of British Columbia, and Ben Cook, with NASA-Goddard. The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, the State of California and the University of California, Santa Barbara. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> (USGS) and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usanpn.org\/\">USA-National Phenology Network<\/a> (USA-NPN) also provided support and assisted with assembling and analyzing historical phenological observations and climate data.\n\n<strong>Future Tracks: Experiments and Observations<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"259\" caption=\"Observing changes in the seasonality of plants in Concord, Massachussets.

They call for standardization of measurements and protocols as well as improvements in experimental design, and continuation and expansion of long-term monitoring efforts like the USA-NPN.\n\nThe USA-NPN brings together citizen scientists, government agencies, non-profit groups, educators and students of all ages to monitor the impacts of climate change on plants and animals in the United States. The USA-NPN was established by the USGS in collaboration with the National Science Foundation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis study underscores the reasons for recent establishment of a USA-NPN to help track, understand, and hopefully forecast different species responses to climate variability and change across the U.S.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS scientist Julio Betancourt, who is a co-author of this new report.\n\n<strong>You Can Help!
