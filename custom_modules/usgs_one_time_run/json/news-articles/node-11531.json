The goals of the awarded projects will be to develop data partnerships and advance the infrastructure required to discover, access, share, manage, and use geospatial data.<\/p>\n<p>In 2008, NSDI CAP awarded a total of 24 projects, totaling just over $1.1 million. One of the 2008 categories is helping organizations build data stewardships for <em>The National Map<\/em> and the NSDI. The overall goal of data stewardships is to produce a national geospatial data inventory of consistent, seamless, integrated data that is continuously improved.
