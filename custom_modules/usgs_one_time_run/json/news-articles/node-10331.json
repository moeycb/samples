Brown, Jr., D-Calif. George Brown was remarkably effective in convincing his colleagues of the value of investing in quality science.<!--introend--> His imprint can be seen on many science programs across the spectrum of government and universities; he nurtured several advances in areas of science that were embryonic when he became their advocate. He was a steadfast champion of programs in environmental research and in earthquake hazards reduction, areas of great interest to the U.S. Geological Survey. We will miss his support and are hopeful that his example will encourage others in the Congress to follow in his footsteps.","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"932097600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170634"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
