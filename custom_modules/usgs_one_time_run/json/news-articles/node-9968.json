Planners and engineers are users of DOQs; their applications include updating changes in land use, transportation and utility corridors. Uses by government agencies include analysis of flood plains, vegetation patterns and timber management, wildlife habitat, and soil erosion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nDOQs are available in computer readable format from USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D. A DOQ User&rsquo;s Guide and Fact Sheet are available from the USGS Earth Science Information Center at 1-800-ASK-USGS. \r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alabama"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"865569600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168933"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
