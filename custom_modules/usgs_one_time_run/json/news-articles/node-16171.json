Now, new USGS research on timeworn samples from the U.S. western mining era show potential new sources of the fundamental ingredients used in 21<sup>st<\/sup>century technologies.<strong><\/strong>\n\nUSGS scientists are reanalyzing rocks, minerals and associated mine tailing samples \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some collected 120 years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to assess their rare and critical elements, which could become potential for economic development.\n\n<strong>Rare earth elements (or metals)<\/strong>\u00c2\u00a0are a set of 17\u00c2\u00a0chemically-related elements, and are specifically made up of the fifteen\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Lanthanide\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lanthanide\" target=\"_blank\">lanthanides<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0plus <a title=\"Scandium\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scandium\" target=\"_blank\">scandium<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Yttrium\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yttrium\" target=\"_blank\">yttrium<\/a>.\u00c2\u00a0Scandium and yttrium are considered rare earth elements since they tend to occur with the lanthanides in nature and exhibit similar chemical properties.\n\nDespite their name, rare earth elements (with the exception of the\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Radioactive decay\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Radioactive_decay\" target=\"_blank\">radioactive<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Promethium\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Promethium\" target=\"_blank\">promethium<\/a>) are\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Abundance of elements in Earth's crust\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust\" target=\"_blank\">relatively plentiful<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0in the\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Crust (geology)\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crust_(geology)\" target=\"_blank\">Earth's crust<\/a>, with\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Cerium\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cerium\" target=\"_blank\">cerium<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0being the 25th most abundant element at 68 parts per million (similar to\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Copper\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copper\" target=\"_blank\">copper<\/a>). However, because of their\u00c2\u00a0<a title=\"Geochemical\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Geochemical\" target=\"_blank\">geochemical<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0properties, rare earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated\u00c2\u00a0in economically exploitable ore deposits.\n\nIn addition to studying the nature and occurrence of rare earth elements, the USGS is conducting research on the distribution, occurrence and understanding of a range of new technology critical (strategic) minerals such as indium, tellurium, gallium and all others. These rare metals are of increasing interest due to their usage in many new materials such as LCD screen, solar cells and medical imaging devices.\n\n\"Without rare earths we'd be back to having black-and-white cellphones again,\" said Ian Ridley, director of the USGS Central Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center in Denver, Colo.\n\n<strong>Laser Ablation Technology Helps Tap into Old Samples<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_182182\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"571\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/LabEquipREE.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-182182\" title=\"LabEquipREE\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/LabEquipREE.jpg\" alt=\"USGS Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) Lab in Denver, Colo.

The technique utilizes a high energy laser to \u00e2\u0080\u009czap\u00e2\u0080\u009d a small hole in the sample and introduce it into the mass spectrometer (the ICP-MS part of the system). In doing so, the sample in virtually any form (mineral, powder, or even frozen liquids) is directly analyzed without the need for complicated, time-consuming or dangerous acid dissolving of the material. While the systems are still expensive to acquire, and commonly require highly-trained staff to develop and operate, LA-ICP-MS is becoming a common tool in geology, forensic and materials facilities.\n\n<strong>Laser Ablation Lab<\/strong>\n\nThe USGS has been a world leader in the development of methods related to the analyses of geologic and earth related materials. Laser ablation ICP-MS is no exception. The USGS LA-ICP-MS Facility located in Denver, Colo., is one of the premier facilities for a wide range of applications and methods development. The USGS LA-ICP-MS facility is one lab where scientists are working on discovering and comprehending untapped resources, and new contributions to natural resources in the United States.\n\n<strong>Links to USGS programs\/publications that feature Rare Earths<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/mrdata.usgs.gov\/mineral-resources\/ree.html\">Rare Earth Element Deposits: Interactive Map<\/a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_182192\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"583\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/SampleREE.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-182192\" title=\"SampleREE\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/SampleREE.jpg\" alt=\"This sample is one of several hundred rocks being analyzed by USGS scientists in Denver.
