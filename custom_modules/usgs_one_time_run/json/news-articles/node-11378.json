This can stress and cause death in bottom-dwelling organisms in the Gulf. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio and Mississippi make up only one-third of the 31-state Mississippi River drainage area, but contribute more than 75 percent of nitrogen and phosphorus to the Gulf. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nCorn and soybean cultivation is the largest contributor of nitrogen to the Gulf. Animal manure on pasture and rangelands and crop cultivation are the largest contributors of phosphorus. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"podcasttemplate\" align=\"right\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><br \/>\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"bold\">\r\n\t\t\tNutrient Sources and Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia\r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absMiddle\" \/> <a href=\"\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep27\/20080129_27_Hypoxia.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | <a href=\"\/corecast\/details.asp?ID=57\">Details<\/a>\r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/>\r\n\t\t\tor you can <a href=\"\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>. \r\n\t\t\t<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<!--End podcast snippet-->These are among the new findings in a USGS report, <em>Differences in Phosphorus and Nitrogen Delivery to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River Basin<\/em>, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

The report shows that animal manure on pasture and range lands contribute nearly as much phosphorus as cultivated crops, 37 versus 43 percent. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe study suggests that phosphorus associated with the wastes of unconfined animals is a much larger source of phosphorus in the Mississippi River Basin than previously recognized. Current animal manure management emphasizes controlling nutrients primarily from confined animal facilities. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe study reports that 66% of nitrogen originates primarily from cultivated crops, mostly corn and soybean, with animal grazing and manure contributing only about 5 percent. Atmospheric contributions also are important, accounting for 16% of nitrogen. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe USGS findings help fill important gaps in information on sources of phosphorus in the Mississippi River Basin at a time when recognition of phosphorus is expanding as an important contributor to Gulf hypoxia. The joint federal-state Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force is evaluating recommendations by \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nthe Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s Science Advisory Board to set reduction targets of at least 45 percent for both nitrogen and phosphorus in an effort to shrink the size of the &quot;hypoxic zone&quot; in half (to 5000 square kilometers) by 2015.
