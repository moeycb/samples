The current level of natural gas development in much of the country, and its effects on the landscape, is an important contemporary land-use\/land-cover issue.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Large-scale landscape disturbance can have a significant impact on ecological resources and the services they provide. This study provides a quantitative look at the levels of disturbance, forest loss and other changes to land use and land cover,\" said Terry Slonecker, lead author of the research.<\/p>\r\n<p>Data from this report will be used to assess the effects of disturbance and land-cover change on wildlife, water quality, invasive species and socioeconomic impacts, among other investigations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The study found that in Fayette County, 1297 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 1765.1 hectares of disturbance, including 466.9 kilometers (290 miles) of new roads and 3.7 kilometers (2 miles) of new pipelines. Disturbance in Fayette County occurs on the western side of the county.<\/p>\r\n<p>In Lycoming County, 83 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 421 hectares of disturbance, including 37 kilometers (22 miles) of new roads and 73.7 kilometers (45 miles) of new pipelines. Disturbance in Lycoming County is scattered with most of it occurring in clusters in the eastern and western edges of the county.<\/p>\r\n<p>The study, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2013\/1119\">Landscape consequences of natural gas extraction in Fayette and Lycoming Counties, Pennsylvania, 2004-2010<\/a>,\" by E.T.
