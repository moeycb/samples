Throughout, the USGS used its natural hazard expertise to convey the reality of disasters and how to prevent those disasters from becoming catastrophes.\n\nNow the effort is going national.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are incredibly proud of the many ways our scientists have helped emergency responders, business and community leaders, and our agency partners to understand what they might face and how to improve readiness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David Applegate, Associate Director for USGS Natural Hazards.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur ultimate goal is to help build safer communities with our science. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the success in the Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project, and we want to share that across the Nation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n<h3>Science Application for Risk Reduction<\/h3>\nThe USGS has evolved the Multi-Hazards Demonstration Project into a project called SAFRR (Science Application for Risk Reduction), which will build on the successful techniques developed during the 5-year pilot to create the way natural hazard science is applied for the safety, security, and economic well-being of the Nation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe expansion to a national effort is an excellent move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Featherstone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere in southern California, the USGS has helped us plan for events outside our everyday experience. The science has been instrumental in helping the emergency management community know what to expect when a natural disaster occurs. That kind of information, in the hands of emergency managers across the country, will be a great step forward in making communities across America safer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSAFRR will work with traditional and non-traditional partners, in research institutions, communities, businesses, and governments, to improve utilization of existing natural hazards information from the USGS, to identify needs and gaps, and to develop new products that increase the use of USGS science.\n\nThe scope of SAFRR efforts will vary based on particular needs. Some projects will be very local, some regional, and some national. Scenarios akin to ShakeOut and ARkStorm will remain a cornerstone of activity. These science-based scenarios are recognized internationally as a fundamental shift in the way science can communicate to serve society.\n\nBut scenarios are only one way that SAFRR can help to make the Nation safer from natural hazards.\n\nDespite its brief existence, SAFRR is already immersed in efforts that hint at the breadth and possibilities of the project.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"343\" caption=\"Scientists probe California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coastline to unearth traces of paleotsunami.
