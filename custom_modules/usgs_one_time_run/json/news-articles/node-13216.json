The ARkStorm is essentially two historic storms (January 1969 and February 1986) put back to back in a scientifically plausible way. The model is not an extremely extreme event.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Jones noted that the largest damages would come from flooding &mdash; the models estimate that almost one-fourth of the houses in California would experience some flood damage from this storm.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The time to begin taking action is now, before a devastating natural hazard event occurs,\" said USGS Director, Marcia McNutt. \"This scenario demonstrates firsthand how science can be the foundation to help build safer communities. The ARkStorm scenario is a scientifically vetted tool that emergency responders, elected officials and the general public can use to plan for a major catastrophic event to help prevent a hazard from becoming a disaster.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>To define im","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["biology","water","geology","Rk Storm"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1294981200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169698"},{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
