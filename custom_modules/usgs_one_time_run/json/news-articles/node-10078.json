Because every coastal area, river, and stream from Mississippi to the Florida panhandle experienced serious life-threatening flooding, this information is critical to emergency management officials who must be prepared to respond to future severe weather situations. \n<p>Hydrologic effects of hurricanes and tropical systems are studied by sending field personnel to find, mark, and survey the evidence of elevations of high water during and after major storms. Record flood stages of 20.4 feet occurred at Flomaton, Alabama, on the Escambia River; 21.4 feet at Crestview, Florida, on the Shoal River; and 25.57 feet at Baker, Florida, on the Blackwater River. Storm surge was 9.6 feet in Pascagoula, Mississippi, at Bayou Chico, which was struck by the dangerous northeast quadrant of the hurricane. Surges of 8.8 feet above mean sea level in Biloxi, Mississippi; 8.0 feet in Mobile Bay and 8.5 in downtown Mobile, Alabama; and 7.7 at Pensacola, Beach, Florida, were recorded. \r\n<p>Storm surge is an abnormal rise in sea level that accompanies a hurricane or other intense storm, and whose height is the difference between the observed level of the sea surface and the level that would have occurred in the absence of the storm. Storm surge and wave height combine to inundate coastal areas. Ongoing studies of storm surge are conducted by the USACE and USGS to understand beach erosion and improve our ability to predict both long- and short-term coastal ero sion and future inundation. \r\n<p>More lives are lost to floods and storm surge during and after a hurricane than from high winds. Real-time stage and discharge data provided by the USGS on the web allows immediate access to water information during storms.
