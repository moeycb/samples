As far back as 1882, Frank W. Clarke, then a professor at the University of Cincinnati, prepared a table of atomic weights for use in science, industry, and trade. He carried on this work as Chief Chemist of the USGS (1883-1924). Clarke was a founder of the American Chemical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Recently, IUPAC has overseen the periodic evaluation and dissemination of atomic-weight values.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Water Hydrologic Researchand Development"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","National News Release"],"distribution":["Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1379995200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169373"},{"tid":"169750"},{"tid":"170637"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
