The oil is believed to be contained in a gravel holding area. Crews are checking now to ensure that the oil has not spread beyond the holding area. Hazardous materials crews from the Fairfax County Fire Department were on-scene early this morning and found no evidence of oil beyond the containment area but contract haz-mat crews are monitoring around the USGS campus to determine if there are any environmental impacts. As much as 15,000 gallons of diesel oil are unaccounted for but are thought to be contained. <\/p>\r\n<p>Currently, the USGS building is open and employees are reporting as usual. There are no fuel odors beyond the immediate area of the holding tanks which are located several hundred feet away from the main building. <\/p>\r\n<p>Representatives from the USGS Office of Communications are on hand to escort members of the media to the site if desired.
