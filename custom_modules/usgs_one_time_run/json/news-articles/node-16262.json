Here are some tips for watching sea otters, suggested by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.montereybayaquarium.org\/cr\/sorac.aspx\">Monterey Bay Aquarium<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/ventura\/\">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<\/a>.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Take caution in areas where sea otters are known to be present.<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep a safe distance from sea otters and other wildlife. If the otter notices you, you are likely too close and should back away.<\/li>\n\t<li>Keep pets on a leash on and around docks and harbors.<\/li>\n\t<li>Never feed sea otters or other wildlife. Wild animals that are fed can become aggressive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>#OtterWeek Resources<\/strong>\n\nFrom September 21-27, 2014, research and education institutions in California and around the U.S. are hosting sea otter science events as part of the annual <strong>Sea Otter Awareness Week<\/strong>.\n\nLook for public lectures featuring scientists from USGS and other organizations <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seaotterweek.org\/\">in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schedule<\/a>, and use the hashtag <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23SeaOtterWeek\">#SeaOtterWeek<\/a> when you share otter science facts online!\n\n<strong>For Reporters<\/strong>\n\nData and figures from the annual survey are available on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/seaottercount\">the USGS project website<\/a>.
