They include:<\/p>\r\n<p>Studies focusing on drought and fire, specifically:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Providing information to resource managers about how future precipitation will affect fire frequency and how that may impact species distribution in the South Central United States.<\/li>\r\n<li>Assessing drought resilience in communities by analyzing drought exposure, impacts and adaptation. <\/li>\r\n<li>Creating a better understanding of drought dynamics and fire weather forecasting by linking precipitation variability, soil and air temperatures, and daily temperature changes.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Efforts to foster better ways to communicate climate science, including:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Developing effective tools for communicating drought information.<\/li>\r\n<li>Identifying vulnerabilities by initiating studies to assess tribal climate change and extreme event response. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The continuing drought in the South Central U.S. is a strong reminder of the impact changing climate can have on our lives,&rdquo; said Kim Winton, South Central Climate Science Center director. &ldquo;Thus we have focused our projects on understanding the implications of long-term drought and how to best communicate our findings to natural and cultural resource managers and to the public.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Each of the Department of the Interior's eight&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/csc\/\">Climate Science Centers<\/a> worked with states, tribes, federal agencies, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/landscape-conservation\/lcc.html\">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives<\/a>, universities supporting the CSCs, and other regional partners to identify the highest priority management challenges in need of scientific input, and to solicit and select research projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>The studies will be undertaken by teams of scientists from the universities, tribes, USGS, as well as other partners such as NOAA&rsquo;s Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program, NOAA&rsquo;s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, the USDA&rsquo;s Southern Plains Regional Climate Hub, and the&nbsp;Landscape Conservation Cooperatives in the South Central region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The eight <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/CSC_consortia_and_regions.pdf\">DOI Climate Science Centers<\/a> form a national network, and are coordinated by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/\">National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,<\/a> located at the headquarters of Interior's U.S. Geological Survey.
