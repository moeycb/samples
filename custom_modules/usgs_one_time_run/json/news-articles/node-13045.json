It is all part of a scientific study to see how Lake Michigan&rsquo;s waters move along the beach.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the study, scientists will pour a harmless red dye into the lake about one-half mile offshore early in the morning. The red-orange color will likely be visible on the beach, and remain throughout the day.&nbsp; The dye is not harmful to people or wildlife, and it will fade within a couple of days. The beach is not yet open for swimming on this date. Boaters will be asked to stay away from the embayment directly in front of 63<sup>rd<\/sup> Street Beach, so that they do not influence the water currents.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information about the Chicago Park District&rsquo;s more than 7,700 acres of parkland, 570 parks, 26 miles of lakefront, nine museums, two world-class conservatories, 16 historic lagoons, nearly 50 nature areas, thousands of special events, sports and entertaining programs, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chicagoparkdistrict.com\">www.chicagoparkdistrict.com<\/a> or contact the Chicago Park District at <strong>312\/742.PLAY <\/strong>or <strong>312\/747.2001<\/strong> (TTY).
