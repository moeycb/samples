This positive trend was documented in a recently published <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1381\/\">report <\/a>that leads to a better understanding of the natural resources of Lake Mead and Lake Mohave, and the issues that may affect natural resource management of Lake Mead NRA.\n\nComplementing the recent interagency report about the aquatic science research in Lake Mead NRA, the 13-minute video highlights the effective collaboration of local, state and federal agencies focused on water quality and ecosystem health. The video illustrates the\u00c2\u00a0crucial role of science in guiding management of this vital resource (now and into the future) for those who depend on the lake for drinking water, recreation, and electric power.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe pulled together some pretty spectacular imagery, cool graphics, smart scientists, and a great narrator to tell, what I think is, a very strong story on the important role of science in managing the vital water resource that is Lake Mead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS video producer Stephen M. Wessells.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe earlier printed report provided an overview of the science done on Lakes Mead and Mohave, but the video makes it into a compelling story showing how the science is used for the benefit of the ecosystem and people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS hydrologist Dr. Michael R. Rosen.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"310\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/01_28_2013_fKBm15Pdc8_01_28_2013_0\"><img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/01_28_2013\/fKBm15Pdc8_01_28_2013\/medium\/circ1381_cover_for_web.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> USGS Circular 1381: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSynthesis of Aquatic Science for Management of Lakes Mead and Mohave\u00e2\u0080\u009d[\/caption]\n\nLake Mead provides significant benefits that have contributed to the modern development of the southwestern United States. The lake provides important aquatic habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including endangered species, and a diversity of world-class water-based recreational opportunities for more than 8 million visitors annually. It supplies critical storage of water supplies for more than 25 million people in three western states (California, Arizona, and Nevada). Storage within Lake Mead supplies drinking water and provides for the generation of hydropower to deliver electricity for major cities including Las Vegas, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Tucson, and San Diego. It also provides water for irrigation of more than 2.5 million acres (almost 4000 square miles or more than twice the size of the state of Delaware) of croplands.\n\nThe new video, USGS GIP 148, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLake Mead\u00e2\u0080\u0094Clear and Vital,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is available <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/643\">online<\/a>.\n\nAn earlier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3499\">news release <\/a>about the original scientific report,<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1381\/\"> USGS Circular 1381<\/a>, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA synthesis of aquatic science for management of Lakes Mead and Mohave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is also available<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3499\"> online<\/a>.\n\n[SlideDeck2 id=176281]\n\n&nbsp;","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24288","uid":"31","filename":"LakeMeadVideoTryptych.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/LakeMeadVideoTryptych.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"157944","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"613bafd6-9f67-48df-b47a-6d0485a61601","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["aquatic","contaminents","Ecosystem","habitat","LakeMead","Mead","PacificRegion","SouthwestRegion","water","waterquality"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1364907887","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
