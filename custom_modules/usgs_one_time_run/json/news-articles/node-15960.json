{"title":"Studying What Matters: Director Marcia McNutt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2011 Earth Day Message","status":"1","comment":"1","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthday.org\/\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/04\/earthday_oilspill.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-885\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/04\/earthday_oilspill-300x154.jpg\" alt=\"USGS Collects Sediments Samples at Pascagoula Beach\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthday.org\/\"><\/a>\n\nEarth Day was conceived <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthday.org\/earth-day-history-movement\">more than 40 years ago<\/a> in the wake of the horrific Santa Barbara oil spill. On the one year anniversary of yet another major marine oil-spill disaster, it is important for us to remember why paying attention to our planet is so important. \u00c2\u00a0The USGS provides scientific understanding to help us do this, and I was reminded recently of the importance of the USGS mission.\n\nI had traveled to Colorado to speak at a weekend symposium in honor of the 75<sup>th<\/sup> birthday of one of my Physics professors at Colorado College. I opened the symposium with a presentation on the USGS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contributions to the response to the oil spill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the wonderful and heroic work so many of our employees accomplished.\n\nI was asked how working on the oil spill had changed me. Without a second\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation, I said that it had raised my expectations for working on issues of significance. I would never again be able to devote my time to something that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.\u00c2\u00a0 For the rest of the weekend, this became the rallying cry of the speakers after me, as one distinguished Colorado College department graduate after another spoke about how he or she was or would devote his or her career to problems that mattered.\n\nHere at the USGS, every day really <em>is <\/em>Earth Day. Our scientists have devoted their careers to studying and understanding many aspects of Earth and the effects of human activity on our planet. USGS efforts inform decision makers across the United States and around the globe on wise choices for sustainable use of resources and reducing vulnerability to hazards.\n\nThere is no doubt that, while much has changed since 1970, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/start_with_science\/\">issues<\/a> Earth Day exists to address are more relevant than ever. Our Nation faces serious challenges, including impacts from global <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/climate_landuse\/\">climate change<\/a>; increased demand for limited <a href=\"http:\/\/energy.usgs.gov\/\">energy<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/\">mineral<\/a> resources and the need to develop alternative, renewable resources, increased vulnerability to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/natural_hazards\/\">natural hazards<\/a>; loss of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/ecosystems\/\">ecosystems<\/a>; and the importance of understanding our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/water\/\">water resources<\/a>. At the USGS, we know that our strength as a Nation rests on the health of our planet, not just within the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 borders, but across the globe. I urge all of you on Earth Day and every day to make a difference by the wise decisions you make in the use of Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources, because the sum total of all of our actions really matter!\n\n<em>Dr. Marcia McNutt<\/em>\n\nDirector, the United States Geological Survey\n\n<strong>Related information:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/\">Recent News on USGS Research<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/news\/pressreleases\/Statement-by-Secretary-Salazar-Marking-One-Year-Anniversary-of-the-Deepwater-Horizon-Oil-Spill.cfm\">Secretary Salazar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Statement Marking One-Year Anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill<\/a><\/li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/news\/doinews\/Interiors-Sustainability-Plan-Seeks-to-Lessen-Departments-Carbon-Footprint-and-Meet-Energy-Goals.cfm\">Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sustainability Plan<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>USGS Scientists Answer Questions about Climate Change<\/strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>CoreCast: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=152\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=152<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24109","uid":"31","filename":"earthday_oilspill-300x154.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/earthday_oilspill-300x154.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"16418","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"1b897730-6d52-4136-927a-b989bd609591","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":154,"width":300},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["EarthDay","oilspill"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1301251651","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
