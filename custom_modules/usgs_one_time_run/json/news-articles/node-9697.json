Added to gasoline in large amounts to reduce air pollution, MTBE has turned up in groundwater throughout the nation. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would begin phasing out the use of MTBE in gasoline. But even if MTBE is banned today, because it is persistent in the environment, it will be with us for at least a decade, says the study&rsquo;s authors. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Where can I find more information?<\/b> The study, frequently asked questions, a list of states included in the study and and state-specific information are all available online at: <\/p>\r\n<DIV align=center>The USGS National Water Quality Assessment Program<br><a href=\"http:\/\/sd.water.usgs.gov\/public_naw\/vocns\/\">http:\/\/sd.water.usgs.gov\/public_naw\/vocns\/<\/a><\/DIV>\r\n<p><b>Who can I call for details or a quote?<\/b><br>Call USGS scientist and study co-author John Zogorski (605) 355-4560, ext. 214<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"953614800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168993"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
