However, it was emphasized that reduction of vegetation\r\nfuels around home sites was essential for the safety of first responders and\r\nhomeowners.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the most important\r\nlessons from the recent fires and his scientific research, Keeley explained, is\r\nthat land managers need to plan for fires as they plan for earthquakes,\r\ntornadoes, and other natural hazards that can affect communities on a large\r\nscale.  &quot;Just as plants have adapted to\r\nliving in a fire-prone environment, humans need to adapt.&quot;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome actions that were\r\nsuggested in his testimony to reduce fire hazards include road closures in\r\nareas at high risk, such as some forest lands, to help alter negative human and\r\nvehicular impact, restrictions on use of power equipment in wildland areas\r\nduring Santa Ana winds, and more widespread construction of fire-resistant\r\nbarriers, such as the walls currently used to reduce noise pollution, along\r\nfire-prone roadsides.  In addition, since\r\nseveral recent fires have been ignited or worsened by power lines downed in\r\nhigh winds, a more expansive program of underground power lines would also help,\r\nKeeley suggested.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith a projected population increase of fifty percent\r\nin Southern California over the next several\r\ndecades, Keeley said, following the hearing, &quot;these recent fires should be a\r\nwake-up call for future planning efforts. \r\nPre-development decisions should put far greater emphasis on natural\r\nfire hazards.  Science should inform the\r\ninitial land use evaluation process at all levels, and aid in making sound\r\ndecisions for everyone&#39;s benefit.&quot;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">\r\nAdditional Resources:\r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"\/newsroom\/docs\/keeley_testimony.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Congressional Testimony","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1196398800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170469"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
