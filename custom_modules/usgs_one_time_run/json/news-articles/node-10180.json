Landslides, such as debris flows and debris avalanches that occurred inmountainous areas of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada were included inthe study. \r\n<p>The 58\u00c2\u00b0F Fahrenheit threshold identified in the study is a six-day movingaverage of daily maximum temperature. Analyses of the data indicate thethreshold can be useful for issuing warnings of an increased potential forlandslide activity in areas susceptible to snowmeltseasonlandslides.Otherpotential uses include the timing of observations and deployment of field instrumentation to monitor hazardous landslide sites, timingmitigation efforts, and anticipating ighwaymaintenance needs. \r\n<p>Chleborad&rsquo;s report entitled, \"Use of Air Temperature Data to Anticipate theOnset of Snowmelt-Season Landslides,\" USGS open-file number 98-124,may be obtained by contacting the USGS Branch of Information Services at303-202-4700.
