They can examine tiny organisms through microscopes, and learn about creeping earthquake faults (they&rsquo;re not just creepy on Halloween!). Marine scientists will be displaying the strange critters and mineral chimneys discovered during mid-ocean ridge explorations, and students will have the opportunity to compare the volcanic eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Kilauea, learn how to read a map, discover the rocks and minerals of the Bay Area, make their own earthquakes, and much more. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<em>Earth Science Week<\/em> is celebrated Oct. 8-14, 2006. The theme for this annual event is &quot;Be a Citizen Scientist!&quot; and focuses on what it means to be involved in science. Citizen science is real people collecting data, observing, and testing. No formal education in Earth science is needed to be a citizen scientist, only an interest and desire to learn. A citizen scientist is YOU involved in real science and research! \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe USGS in Menlo Park is only one venue in the nationwide celebration for <em>Earth Science Week<\/em>. Earth scientists at universities, government agencies and businesses nationwide are opening their doors to visitors, visiting classrooms, and hosting field trips. <em>Earth Science Week<\/em> was established in 1998 by the American Geological Institute (AGI) to give students and citizens new opportunities to discover Earth sciences and to encourage stewardship of the Earth. It highlights the important contributions that Earth and environmental sciences make to society and invites the public to become engaged in current scientific exploration. AGI and the USGS are sponsoring national essay, visual arts, and photography contests for school children.
