While arsenic concentrations in the Marshall are sufficient to explain the anomalous arsenic in ground water, the mechanism by which arsenic is released is less certain. High levels of arsenic occur naturally in pyrite, a widespread minor constituent of the sandstone,\" says Kolker. \r\n<p>This is one of four USGS Drinking Water Initiative studies to address drinking water issues nationwide.
