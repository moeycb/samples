Now, with this newly recovered material, scientists hope to answer long-standing questions about the fault&#39;s composition and properties. \r\n<p>\r\nAltogether, the geologists retrieved 135 feet of 4-inch diameter rock cores weighing roughly 1 ton. They were brought to the surface through a research borehole drilled more than 2.5 miles into the Earth. The last of the cores was brought to the surface in the predawn hours of Sept. 7. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nScientists seeking to understand how the great faults bounding Earth&#39;s vast tectonic plates evolve and generate earthquakes have always had to infer the processes through indirect means. Up until now, they could only work with samples of ancient faults exposed at the Earth&#39;s surface after millions of years of erosion and uplift, together with computer simulations and laboratory experiments approximating what they think might be happening at the depths at which earthquakes occur. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;Now we can hold the San Andreas Fault in our hands,&quot; said Mark Zoback, the Benjamin M. Page Professor in Earth Sciences at Stanford. &quot;We know what it&#39;s made of. We can study how it works.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nZoback is one of three co-principal investigators of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) project, which is establishing the world&#39;s first underground earthquake observatory. William Ellsworth and Steve Hickman, geophysicists with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Menlo Park, Calif., are the other co-principal investigators. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nSAFOD, which first broke ground in 2004, is a major research component of EarthScope, a National Science Foundation-funded program being carried out in collaboration with the USGS and NASA to investigate the forces that shape the North American continent and the physical processes controlling earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;Th","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1191470400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169050"},{"tid":"169122"},{"tid":"169950"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
