The U.S. Geological Survey AMBLE (Avian Monitoring for Botulism Lakeshore Events) program is an opportunity to sharpen birding skills, gain a deeper understanding of the disease, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/disease_information\/avian_botulism\/\">avian botulism<\/a>, Lake Michigan ecology, and develop a connection with a wild place.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Participants can choose quarter-mile or longer sections of the nearly 300-mile Door County shoreline to monitor every 7 to 10 days, June through November. Expertise in bird identification is not required to be an AMBLE volunteer and free training will be offered in May. Information covered during training includes disease ecology of avian botulism, monitoring protocols, bird identification, and GPS use.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To participate in AMBLE, volunteers are asked to attend one of the two May training sessions (more sessions will be offered as needed):&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Friday, May 20 from 1-4 p.m. at Newport State Park Visitor Center, Hotz Wilderness Room, 475 County Highway NP, Ellison Bay. <\/li>\r\n<li>Saturday, May 21 from 1-4 p.m. at Crossroads at Big Creek, Collins Learning Center, 2041 Michigan St., Sturgeon Bay.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The training sessions are free.&nbsp; Those who complete training will receive an AMBLE hat or t-shirt, and updates throughout the monitoring season via the \"AMBLE Ramble\" newsletter.<\/p>\r\n<p>AMBLE is sponsored by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS National Wildlife Health Center<\/a> with support from the <a href=\"http:\/\/cida.usgs.gov\/glri\/\">Great Lakes Restoration Initiative<\/a> and the following local partners: The Ridges Sanctuary, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, The Nature Conservancy, Northeastern Wisconsin Audubon Society, and Crossroads at Big Creek. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information or to sign up for a training session, contact Jenny Chipault (<a href=\"mailto:AMBLE@usgs.gov\">AMBLE@usgs.gov<\/a> or 608-270-2473) or view the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/mortality_events\/amble\/\">Lake Michigan Volunteer AMBLE website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" id=\"gallery_news\" name=\"NR2011_05_04\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photo_shares\/thumbs\/tags\/NR2011_05_04\/1\" title=\"Image Gallery\">[Access images for this release at: &amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2011_05_04\" _mce_href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2011_05_04\"&amp;amp;gt;http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2011_05_04&amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;gt;]<\/iframe><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["biology","Wisconsin","Door County","Green Bay","Lake Michigan","Avian Botulism","ecosysems","Citizen Science"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1304481600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169619"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
