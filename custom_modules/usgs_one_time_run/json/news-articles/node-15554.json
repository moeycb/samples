From NAWQA monitoring, we now know that nitrate loadings from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico increased 14 percent from 1980 to 2010 despite extensive efforts to improve and expand the use of urban and agricultural management practices during the period.&nbsp;Have governmental actions been effective or are other influences causing the changes?<\/p>\r\n<p>The briefing will also include&nbsp;findings&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's<\/a>&nbsp;(NOAA)&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;to&nbsp;assess&nbsp;the health of the Nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;estuaries and will explain how information&nbsp;and findings&nbsp;from NAWQA&rsquo;s monitoring and assessments&nbsp;contribute to their assessments and the protection of our estuaries.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Alan Vicory, Principal &ndash; Stantec Consulting &amp; Chair &ndash; WEF Government Affairs Committee, Moderator<br \/>Lori Sprague, Coordinator &ndash; NAWQA Surface-Water Trends, U.S. Geological Survey<br \/>Suzanne Bricker, NOAA National Center for Coastal Ocean Science <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Friday, April 11, 2014<br \/>10:00AM &ndash; 11:30AM <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where: &nbsp;<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Congressional Room South, CVC 217<br \/>Washington, D.C.<\/td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>Following presentations by the two speakers, there will be time for questions and discussion from the audience.
