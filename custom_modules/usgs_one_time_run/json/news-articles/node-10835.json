During a flood, teams of USGS hydrographers travel to streamgages to keep the instruments operating and to make crucial calibration measurements of the streamflow.<\/p>\r\n<p>Other information available from this web site for each streamgage include current flood levels, historical peaks and NWS flood forecast information. Monthly flood reports are also available that include maximum flows and compares the data to previous years that observations were made at each station.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in selected streams and rivers across the U.S. The USGS collects data from more than 7,400 streamgages, many of which provide real-time data in 15-minute increments. The information is routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, determination of flood risk, and for many recreational activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Access USGS information for surface and ground water from 1.5 million sites across the U.S., Puerto Rico and Guam through the National Water Information System Web Interface (NWISWeb) by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/\">http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1207281600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169480"},{"tid":"169606"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
