As plants die, the carbon becomes part of the soil and helps the marsh survive sea level rise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCoastal wetlands are among the most economically and ecologically valuable ecosystems on Earth, with their services estimated worth about $15,000 an acre,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Matthew Larsen, associate director for climate and land use research at the U.S. Geological Survey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey provide clean water, abundant food, wildlife habitat, and protection from storms. This and other USGS research aims to understand and forecast the vulnerability of coastal wetland systems to global change and identify ways that managers can effectively respond to global change effects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong>Marshes and Sea Level Rise<\/strong>\n\nKirwan cautioned that the study also showed that marshes can survive only moderately fast rates of sea level rise. To survive, the elevation of the soil surface has to build vertically through time. If the seas rise more quickly than the marsh can build up, marshes drown and die off.\n\n\"At fast levels of sea level rise, no realistic amount of carbon accumulation will help them survive,\" Kirwan noted.\n\nAnd, said Kirwan, if marshes are drowned by fast-rising seas, they no longer would provide a significant carbon storage capacity.\n\n<strong>The Value of Marsh Ecosystems<\/strong>\n\nSalt marshes, made up primarily of grasses, are important coastal ecosystems that provide a variety of ecosystem services for wildlife, fisheries, and people. They help protect shorelines from storms, provide diverse wildlife habitat for birds, mammals, fish, and mollusks. They also build up coastal elevations by trapping sediment during floods, producing new soil from roots and decaying organic matter. New Orleans, for example, is\u00c2\u00a0separated\u00c2\u00a0from the Gulf of Mexico almost entirely by marshes.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"318\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/02_24_2010_b27Ia44Yxs_02_24_2010_0#.UGMqzmNb1Nr\"><img src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/02_24_2010\/b27Ia44Yxs_02_24_2010\/medium\/Little_Blue_Heron_siblings_by_L.D._Igl_USGS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> Little Blue herons in a Louisiana marsh.[\/caption]\n\nDOI manages 35 million acres of low-lying coastal areas, including marshes and thousands of miles of shoreline.
