It can even be traced in our pre-history.\n\nMore than 200 years ago, the first government survey of the natural resources of the American West, Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery (1804-06), was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson and funded by Congress. In carrying out Jefferson's detailed instructions in regard to cartography and scientific goals, the explorers mapped every twist and turn of the Missouri and the Columbia rivers, gathering information about the soils, plants, animals, and native inhabitants of the lands through which they passed.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176099\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/The-National-Map1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176099\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/The-National-Map1-300x172.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot of the USGS National Map\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" \/><\/a> The National Map is a collaborative effort among the USGS and other Federal, State, and local partners to improve and deliver topographic information for the Nation.[\/caption]\n\nIn 1867, shortly after the Civil War ended, Congress authorized the first of a series of major western explorations that were led by Clarence King (USGS first director), F. V. Hayden, George Wheeler, and John Wesley Powell (USGS second director). In 1879, following the National Academy of Sciences recommendation that these surveys be consolidated, the 45<sup>th<\/sup> Congress established the U. S. Geological Survey on March 3 with the mandate to conduct \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe classification of the Public Lands, and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOver a period of 134 years, the USGS has evolved from a small group of scientists and surveyors who provided guidance on how to describe and manage the public lands of the West to a leading Federal science agency that conducts research and assessment activities on complex natural resource and science issues at scales ranging from local to global.\n\n<strong><em>The Survey today<\/em><\/strong>\n\nThe institutional strength of the modern USGS is the broad array of science expertise we have. The USGS operates programs that include natural hazards research, such as our earthquake, volcano, and landslide programs; a network of 8,000 streamgages that monitor water availability and help in forecasting floods; and other programs that investigate invasive species, wildlife disease, and climate change.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Environmental-Health-Image.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176100\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Environmental-Health-Image-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"A USGS scientist stands on the edge of a boat in the Salton Sea of California, collecting a sediment sample from the bottom of the lake.\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> A USGS scientist monitors sediment quality in the Salton Sea of California.

The USGS leverages its resources and expertise in partnership with more than 2,000 agencies of State, local and tribal government, the academic community, other Federal partners, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.\n\nThe Survey does not manage any land or resources or have regulatory responsibilities. Our priority is our \u00e2\u0080\u009cboots on the ground\u00e2\u0080\u009d scientists who work with sophisticated monitoring networks to study our world and its natural processes. Our entire focus is on providing objective, ready-to-work science that decision-makers need to face difficult, multi-faceted issues.\n\nThe Survey conducts vital resource assessments for energy and mineral potential. We also conduct research on the environmental and human health impacts of the production and use of various energy resources. The USGS is the sole Federal source of scientific information and research on nonfuel mineral potential, production, and consumption, as well as on the environmental effects of the extraction and use of mineral resources. To support the development of economic and national security policies in a global context, the USGS collects and analyzes data on essential mineral commodities from around the world.\n\nUSGS maintains the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) whose mission is to rapidly determine the location and size of all destructive earthquakes worldwide and to immediately disseminate this information to concerned national and international agencies, scientists, and the general public.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the largest civilian mapping agency. Furthermore, we continuously observe the Earth through the Landsat satellite program in partnership with NASA. The latest satellite, Landsat 8, was recently launched on February 11 and is expected to be operating by mid-May as an advanced complement to the existing Landsat 7.\n\nToday, with the world population at more than 7 billion and projected to grow to 9 billion by 2040; with competing priorities to balance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the economy, for the environment, for public health and safety; with the serious, perhaps irreversible consequences of climate change and sea-level rise to consider, our leaders need scientific information about the land and its resources that they can trust with the greatest confidence to guide their decisions.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176097\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Remote-Sensing-in-20131.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176097\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Remote-Sensing-in-20131-300x226.jpg\" alt=\"An artist's rendition of the Landsat 8 satellite in orbit around Earth\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a> USGS and NASA co-operate Landsat 8, the latest satellite in the longest-operating continuous Earth-observing mission.

This wealth and breadth of data provides an invaluable framework for understanding climate and environmental changes that are taking place today.\n\n<strong><em>Data in demand<\/em><\/strong>\n\nPublic demand for USGS scientific findings and data is strong and growing stronger. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iea.org\/\">International Energy Agency<\/a> has said of us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most widely respected source of information on global conventional oil and gas resources is the U.S. Geological Survey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A May 2012 article in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.academia.edu\/2504128\/Top-cited_articles_in_environmental_sciences_Merits_and_demerits_of_citation_analysis\">a respected international journal<\/a> found that the U.S. Geological Survey is the most cited institution in the world<strong> <\/strong>for environmental science.\n\nOther broad sectors of the public and the emergency response community have come to rely on USGS for timely, robust, reliable hazard information. For example, USGS supplies rapid assessments of earthquake fatalities and economic losses; real-time flood inundation mapping to support emergency response; predictions of coastal impacts from hurricanes 48 hours prior to hurricane landfall; debris-flow susceptibility maps; rapid notification of the onset of a volcanic eruption at high-threat volcanoes; and real-time wildfire condition information to support fire fighters.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176115\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Energy-Image.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176115\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/Energy-Image-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a> A drill rig in the Fayetteville Shale gas play of Arkansas. USGS assesses energy and mineral resources critical to the Nation's security and economy.[\/caption]\n\n<strong><em>A birthday in unusual circumstances<\/em><\/strong>\n\nWhether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our birthday or just a regular day in early March, the USGS, like many other Federal agencies, faces the near-term prospect of across-the-board sequestration cuts to its staff and monitoring capabilities. Budget sequestration will impact our ability, immediately and for months ahead, to provide the critical science needed to minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters. The entire USGS workforce in every state across the country will be faced with the prospect of furloughs. This substantial loss of employee productivity, coupled with the uncertainty of funding key operating contracts and research grants, will inevitably degrade our monitoring and forecasting capabilities nationwide.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences, the same prestigious body that recommended the establishment of the Survey in 1879, recently released (Feb. 2012) a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nap.edu\/catalog.php?record_id=13302\">rigorous review<\/a> of the importance of international programs at USGS. The Academy concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA global, integrated understanding of the Earth sciences is of fundamental importance to enhance U.S. public health and security, safeguard our natural heritage, and support economic development. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6. As the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading, integrated Earth science agency, the [USGS] has a significant role to play in contributing information and knowledge to address Earth science issues arising in and beyond U.S. national boundaries.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe leadership, scientists, and employees of USGS heartily concur. Across the United States, we want the best science about the Earth and its natural resources to be readily available so that it can be used effectively in making vital decisions that will affect our fellow citizens, our communities, and the environment.\n\n[SlideDeck2 id=176075]","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24280","uid":"31","filename":"USGS-134-Years-of-Science-for-America2.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/USGS-134-Years-of-Science-for-America2.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"66008","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"eb387f94-a820-4806-a063-c0571870de50","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":330,"width":684},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Earth Science","natural science","USGS"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1362432941","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
