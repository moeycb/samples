Buland<\/strong>\nDr. Raymond P. Buland has demonstrated outstanding scientific insight, technical knowledge, and management skills as he designed and led a team that developed a cutting-edge computer-based system for rapid analysis of earthquake data. \u00c2\u00a0This system is the operational core of the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) and is based on advanced concepts in seismology, pattern recognition and association, statistics, telecommunications, and software and hardware integration. \u00c2\u00a0The NEIC system automatically detects seismic disturbances on more than 1,000 data links from seismometers worldwide, associates these detections with single events, and automatically computes earthquake locations, magnitudes, and other source characteristics. \u00c2\u00a0Earthquake information and estimated impacts are used by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the White House. \u00c2\u00a0Data from the system were essential in providing swift earthquake disaster relief to Haiti and Chile following large earthquakes in early 2010, expediting U.S. Government assessment of and response to these disasters. \u00c2\u00a0In addition to his leadership in creating NEIC data analysis systems, Dr. Buland also directed development of the U.S. National Seismic Network, a nationwide network of modern digital seismographs designed to provide a uniform basis for coverage of earthquake activity across the nation.\n<strong><\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173584\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"118\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/Carla-Burzick.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173584  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/Carla-Burzick-241x300.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Carla Burzyk\" width=\"118\" height=\"147\" \/><\/a> Ms. Carla Burzyk[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Carla M.
