The USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of State&#39;s Agency\r\nfor International Development, hosted the Iraqis at the USGS Idaho Water\r\nScience Center in Boise. The training in Boise was the third phase of a\r\ncooperative training and assistance program. In 2005 and 2006, USGS scientists\r\ntraveled to Iraq to help construct automated streamgaging stations on the\r\nTigris and Euphrates Rivers. The stations, part of a revitalized hydrologic\r\nmonitoring network, will allow the Iraq Ministry of Water Resources to track\r\nreal-time streamflow data much as the USGS does in its vast streamflow\r\nmonitoring network in the U.S. The real-time information is critical to\r\neffectively managing Iraq&#39;s vital water resources, thereby improving the\r\nquality of life for millions of Iraqi citizens.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<span class=\"bold\">Note to reporters<\/span>: A high-quality JPEG version of the above photo is available upon\r\nrequest.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Idaho"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1198040400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170582"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
