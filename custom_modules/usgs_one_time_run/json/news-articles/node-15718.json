Improvements to symbol definitions (color, line thickness, line symbols, area fills), layer order, and annotation fonts are additional features of this latest update. The maps also have transparency for some features and layers to increase visibility of multiple competing layers.<\/p>\n<p>This new design was launched earlier this year and is now part of the new US Topo quadrangles for Alabama (840 maps), replacing the first edition US Topo maps for the states.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Users in our state are very excited about the three year revision cycle of the US Topo maps,&rdquo; said George Heleine, the Geospatial Liaison for Alabama and Mississippi. &nbsp;&ldquo;The Alabama Department of Transportation says that due to increased growth within the state, updated maps will significantly increase their utility across all disciplines within State Government&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>US Topo maps are updated <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/about.html\">every three years<\/a>.
