Little did he know that the two were joined through the atmosphere. Over the past few decades, the occasional presence of swordfish and marlin off the Oregon coast, when they are normally found in warmer waters far to the south, and flooding in Southern California seem unconnected, but both are examples of the intimate relationship between conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the adjacent continent. In the west, trees are flowering earlier in the year, affecting the animals that rely on them as a food source; there is less snow in the Sierra Nevada, and it is melting earlier in the year, leaving less water available for irrigation in the summer; and flood events and winter storms are increasing in intensity. There is renewed interest in the atmospheric conditions that led to extensive flooding in the Central Valley in 1862 and using that information to predict how well California can respond if a similar storm system were to hit California today.<\/p>\r\n<p>See conference session titles below for research presented by USGS scientists at the Pacific Climate Workshop.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>ORAL PRESENTATIONS<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>All oral presentations will be held in the Fred Farr Forum, Asilomar Conference Grounds<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Monday &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>9:50-10:15 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Examining Gulf of Alaska Marine Paleoclimate at Seasonal to Decadal Timescales<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Jason A.
