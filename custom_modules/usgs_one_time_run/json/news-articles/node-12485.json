Six solvents were detected at high concentrations, above health standards for drinking water. High solvent concentrations were generally clustered in the central and southern San Gabriel Valley, and the southern San Fernando Valley. Solvents are used for a number of purposes include metal plating, machinery degreasing, and dry cleaning. Perchlorate, an ingredient in rocket fuel, fireworks, safety flares, and fertilizers, was also detected at high concentrations in about 11 percent of the groundwater in the study-area aquifers. Nutrients, such as nitrate and nitrite, are used in fertilizers, and result from nitrogenous waste, were present at high concentrations in about 9 percent of the groundwater in the aquifers.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Results from this study indicate that human activities such as industry and agriculture are the primary factors affecting local groundwater quality throughout the San Fernando and San Gabriel groundwater basins,&rdquo; said Dr. Justin Kulongoski, a hydrologist and author of the USGS report prepared in collaboration with the California State Water Resources Control Board.<\/p>\r\n<p>The State Water Resources Control Board&rsquo;s Groundwater Ambient Monitoring &amp; Assessment Program, which funded the study, is a collaboration with the USGS to monitor and assess water quality in 120 groundwater basins across California over a ten-year period. The main goals of GAMA are to improve comprehensive statewide groundwater monitoring and to increase the availability of groundwater-quality information to the public.<\/p>\r\n<p>The full report, <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2011\/5206\">Status of Groundwater Quality in the San Fernando&ndash;San Gabriel Study Unit, 2005: California GAMA Priority Basin Project,<\/a> and the accompanying non-technical <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2011\/3139\/\">Fact Sheet,<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2011\/3139\">Groundwater Quality in the San Fernando-San Gabriel Groundwater Basins, California<\/a>, are online.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","groundwater","solvent","San Fernando","San Gabriel","aquifer","","Water Quality"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1332388800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169421"},{"tid":"169928"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
