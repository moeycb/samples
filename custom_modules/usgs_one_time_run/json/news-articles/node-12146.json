Major factors that aided the aquifer&rsquo;s recovery include; a 49-percent decrease in municipal water withdrawals from the aquifer by the City of Wichita between 1993 and 2009, a greater reliance on Cheney Reservoir, and an increase in annual precipitation. To help meet future water requirements, the ASR program is using water from the Little Arkansas River to artificially recharge the <em>Equus<\/em> Beds aquifer. Results of this ongoing cooperative study between the USGS and the City of Wichita can be found <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/preview\/sir\/2010\/5231\/\">online<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This study demonstrates that the city&rsquo;s combined efforts of the Aquifer Storage and Recovery program and decreasing city pumpage are resulting in large benefits to the aquifer,&rdquo; said Deb Ary, Superintendent of Production and Pumping of Wichita Water Utilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ASR program is a key component in the City of Wichita&rsquo;s long-range plans to meet water needs through 2050 and is vital for restoration of the depleted <em>Equus <\/em>Beds aquifer. The artificial recharge during 2007-2009 contributed about 2,600 acre-feet of water near the recharge sites. The program takes high flows from the Little Arkansas River, cleans it to drinking water quality and recharges the water into the aquifer. In an extended drought, or if increased water demands occur, the city will withdraw the recharged water to meet needs. The ASR program is also designed to help Wichita protect the aquifer from the intrusion of saltwater from natural and human-related sources.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>More information about USGS studies in the <em>Equus <\/em>Beds can be found on the USGS Kansas Water Science Center <a href=\"http:\/\/ks.water.usgs.gov\/studies\/equus\">online<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Kansas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Kansas","aquifer","equus","wateravailability","waterstorage","wichita"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1301544000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169115"},{"tid":"169262"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
