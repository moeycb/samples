{"title":"Photo\/Interview Opportunity: USGS Scientists Sample Bay Waters For Pesticides","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Hydrologists and chemists from the U.S. Geological Survey will be on Mallard Island, near Pittsburg today, Jan. 8, collecting water and sediment samples from Bay-Delta waters to determine the amount of pesticides that are being washed into the Bay by this year&rsquo;s floods on Bay-Delta rivers. \n<p>The USGS sampling crew will leave their floating laboratory at the Pittsburg Marina at approximately 2:15 p.m., and arrive at the Mallard Island site approximately 15 minutes later. The sampling will be done at 3:15 p.m., which coincides with the afternoon high tide. \r\n<p>News media who wish to accompany the USGS scientists to the sampling site should meet them at the Pittsburg Marina no later than 2:15 p.m., or at the Mallard Island site between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. \r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t miss the USGS portable laboratory at the Pittsburg Marina -- it&rsquo;s a big pontoon boat, covered with blue canvass, at Dock I. \r\n<p>The Mallard Island site is accessible by vehicle, but access is controlled by Pacific Gas and Electric. Reporters and support crews should be prepared to show their press credentials to the PG&amp;E gatekeeper. \r\n<p>The USGS chief scientist for this sampling project is Kathy Kuivila. She may be reached on a cell phone at 916-768-8725. \r\n<p>For additional information on the USGS flood monitoring and sampling program, call the USGS Public Affairs Office in Menlo Park at 415-329-4000. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Pennsylvania"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"852699600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
