Tips are presented in topic areas, chronologically with room numbers, session numbers and a summary. The AGU conference is held Dec. 3-7 at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.<\/p>\r\n<p>News media representatives are invited to visit the USGS booth in the AGU Exhibit Hall. This is an easy place to connect with USGS and the staff working at the booth will have data, publications, and information.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fallmeeting.agu.org\/2012\/media-center\/2012-press-conference-schedule\/\">News Conferences - Moscone West, Room 3000<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Improving forecasts of &ldquo;Pineapple Expresses&rdquo;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Monday, 12\/3 at 1:30 p.m. &ndash; USGS&rsquo;s Michael Dettinger and NOAA<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Superstorm Sandy, Black Swan cyclones and the economic toll to come<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Monday, 12\/3 at 4 p.m. &ndash; USGS&rsquo;s Hilary Stockdon<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Natural or man-made?

As a result, our findings indicate that evapotranspiration rates in the Delta are lower than for similar crops grown outside the region. Our intention is to update resource models to reflect these reduced ET rates and generate more accurate water-use maps for this region of statewide hydrologic importance.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Monday, 12\/3, 8 a.m., MS Poster Hall<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Tidal marsh accretion processes in the San Francisco Bay-Delta &ndash; are our models underestimating the historic and future importance of plant-mediated organic accretion?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>USGS scientist: Lisamarie Windham-Myers<\/p>\r\n<p>PP11D-2055\/Poster<\/p>\r\n<p>Peat-accreting coastal wetlands can potentially keep pace with sea-level rise, mitigating expected rises in atmospheric greenhouse gases.
