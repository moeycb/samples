But, they have uses other than jewelry. For instance, gold is a required element in computers and in jet engines. Diamonds, in addition to being a highly-sought after gemstone, are one of the most versatile engineering materials because their supreme toughness and durability makes them the cutting material of choice in many industrial operations. <strong>Learn more about <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/commodity\/gold\/\"><strong>gold<\/strong><\/a><strong> and <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/commodity\/diamond\/\"><strong>diamonds<\/strong><\/a><strong>!<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Live Without<\/strong>\n\nThe previous minerals are, indeed, important and necessary, but there are also lesser-known minerals we take for granted that power our modern conveniences. For example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading this article on a smart phone or other mobile device, then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re indebted to a series of elements called \u00e2\u0080\u009crare earths.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRare earths are a series of 17 elements, with unusual names like Yttrium, Scandium and the Lanthanides. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re called rare earths because, although they are abundant in the soil, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hard to find in concentrations that are profitable to mine. These elements, though, are necessary for smart phones and mobile devices because they can yield rare-earth magnets, which allow vital computing components to be miniaturized. <strong>Find out <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/commodity\/rare_earths\/\"><strong>more<\/strong><\/a><strong> about rare earths!<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Guess Again: The Most Valuable Mineral<\/strong>\n\nUp until the recession, the most valuable mineral by total value produced in the United States was not what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect. Nope -- it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gold, silver or platinum. Instead, it was crushed stone, mostly used in construction. Although each individual unit is fairly low in cost, billions of tons of crushed stone are used each year for building and repairing roads, buildings, houses, and other projects. It adds up! \u00c2\u00a0<strong>Find out <a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/commodity\/stone_crushed\/\">more <\/a><\/strong><strong> about crushed stone!<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Following the Money<\/strong>\n\nBecause\u00c2\u00a0 minerals are so important, USGS has placed a priority on researching and tracking the flow of nearly 90 mineral commodities important to the economy and national security of the United States. In fact, USGS issues an annual mineral commodity report, tracking the reserves, production, refining and use of these minerals in the United States and about 180 other countries. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called the <a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/mcs\/\">Mineral Commodity Summaries<\/a>, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/minerals\/pubs\/mcs\/2012\/mcs2012.pdf\">2012 edition<\/a> was just published.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174049\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"212\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/05\/Minerals-Graph.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174049\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/05\/Minerals-Graph-212x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Each year, USGS calculates US net reliance on imports for 70 mineral commodities.
