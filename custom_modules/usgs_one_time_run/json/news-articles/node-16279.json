They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sold in beachcombing shops as rock-hard, dried specimens for home d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and artists use their symmetric shapes as motifs for ocean-inspired patterns. But sea stars are actually soft-bodied, colorful, mobile animals that hunt and feed on the ocean bottom, and since 2013, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seastarwasting.org\/\">a mysterious disease has been killing them in droves<\/a> along the U.S. and Canadian Pacific Coast\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SOgOe3pH5Qc\">causing their arms to fall off and spilling their innards<\/a>, and wasting away their bodies as if a heat gun were melting them from the inside.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cSea Star Wasting Disease\u00e2\u0080\u009d behind this deadly epidemic has been intensely studied by marine scientists in recent months, and now, a prime suspect has finally been identified as a probable cause of the disease.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Researchers from Cornell University, U.S. Geological Survey, and other institutions managed to isolate and analyze the genome of a previously unidentified virus in the sick sea stars. They published their findings on this \u00e2\u0080\u009csea star associated densovirus (SSaDV)\u00e2\u0080\u009d today in\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/12\/1416625111.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/a><span style=\"color: #0080c0; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0<\/span><\/span>(<a href=\"http:\/\/mediarelations.cornell.edu\/2014\/11\/17\/densovirus-named-top-suspect-in-devastating-sea-star-wasting-disease\/\" target=\"_blank\">click to read the Cornell University press release<\/a>).\n\nLed by Cornell University microbiologist <a href=\"http:\/\/hewsonlab.micro.cornell.edu\/\">Ian Hewson<\/a> with Cornell disease ecologist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eeb.cornell.edu\/harvell\">Drew Harvell<\/a>, the study team comprises researchers from a who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who of science institutions: Western Washington University, Wildlife Conservation Society, University of California-Davis, California Science Center, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Monterey Bay Aquarium, National Parks Service, University of South Florida, USGS, University of California-Santa Cruz, Seattle Aquarium, University of Washington, University of Connecticut, and Vancouver Aquarium.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The sea star mortality was so sudden and unprecedented that biologists were unprepared and short on resources, says study coauthor <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/lafferty\">Kevin Lafferty<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">, a marine ecologist and parasite specialist with the <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Western Ecological Research Center<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLots of people were scrambling to learn what was going on.

It became personal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSea star die-offs have been observed in past decades, but none were <a href=\"http:\/\/data.piscoweb.org\/marine1\/seastardisease.html\">at this geographic scale<\/a>. Since June 2013, Sea Star Wasting Disease cases have been reported from Baja California in Mexico, southern California, northern California, Oregon, and all the way to southern Alaska. Worse, as many as 20 sea star species have been affected.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00c2\u00a0<\/span>\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening underwater, this devastation may be difficult for many people to picture,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Lafferty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut imagine if all the songbirds from Alaska to Mexico started falling out of the sky, dropping their wings and disintegrating into a pile of feathers. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d wonder if you were in an Old Testament-style plague.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nScientists raced to find a cause, ranging from pollution to storm surge damage. But when Sea Star Wasting Disease began to hit an aquarium that used natural seawater from the ocean, new clues emerged.\n\nThe disease did not spread into tanks where incoming seawater was treated with ultraviolet light, but it did spread into tanks with untreated water\u00e2\u0080\u0094suggesting that a living pathogen was in play, instead of a chemical pollutant. Furthermore, trapping mechanisms like sand filters did not halt the disease spread from tank to tank, suggesting that the pathogen was microscopic and transferable by water, rather than only via direct contact between infected sea stars.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"5472\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/11_14_2014_yd7Gwk3VVq_11_14_2014_3#.VGoqgvTF_6e\"><img title=\"Sea Star Death from Sea Star Wasting Disease\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/11_14_2014\/yd7Gwk3VVq_11_14_2014\/large\/SSWD3_Kevin_Lafferty.jpg\" alt=\"Sea urchins crawl upon the disintegrated corpse of a sea star that succumbed to Sea Star Wasting Disease\u00e2\u0080\u0094a smattering of unrecognizable white matter.

The tissue was minced and blended in seawater, then passed through super-fine filters designed to remove bacteria but allow smaller materials\u00e2\u0080\u0094including viruses\u00e2\u0080\u0094to pass through.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">This filtered blend was then injected into healthy sea stars, which all began to show wasting symptoms after two weeks. Researchers then took tissue from this set of newly diseased sea stars to create a second blend, injecting this into yet another group of healthy sea stars. Sure enough, these sea stars also showed wasting symptoms after two weeks.<\/span>\n\nMeanwhile, another group of healthy sea stars was subjected to the same experiment, but they were injected with a boiled version of the blend intended to destroy any biologically active material. None of these sea stars developed wasting symptoms, and the experiments proved that some sort of virus-sized, biologically active entity could trigger wasting symptoms in one sea star, and continue to infect others.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"2481\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/11_14_2014_yd7Gwk3VVq_11_14_2014_4#.VGoq-_TF_6d\"><img title=\"Sunflower Sea Star (Pycnopodium helianthoides)\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/11_14_2014\/yd7Gwk3VVq_11_14_2014\/large\/SSWD4_Kevin_Lafferty.jpg\" alt=\"The sunflower sea star (Pycnopodium helianthoides) can be found in a variety of colors in the wild, like this healthy specimen with a lavender hue.

We were able to assemble a near-complete viral genome from the sick sea stars\u00e2\u0080\u0094a densovirus genome new to scientific record\u00e2\u0080\u0094and gave it a name: \u00e2\u0080\u0098sea star associated densovirus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or SSaDV.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut was SSaDV also related to wasting symptoms in sea stars in the wild? Drew Harvell, the marine disease specialist at Cornell, had been making field observations of the wasting disease and collected samples for the viral genome analysis. She rallied researchers at different institutions to gather tissue from more than 300 sick and healthy sea stars from the wild, across 14 different species. Kevin Lafferty at USGS then performed statistical analyses on the results. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe confirmed that wild sea stars were more likely to be diseased if they carried a high viral load of SSaDV,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Lafferty.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Many-Armed Mystery<\/strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe style=\"font-size: 13px;\" title=\"Sea Star Wasting Disease in the Sunflower Star (Pycnopodia helianthoides)\" name=\"Sea Star Wasting Disease in the Sunflower Star (Pycnopodia helianthoides)\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/SOgOe3pH5Qc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"800\" height=\"625\"><\/iframe>\n\n<em>A video by Robert Beck of Brigham Young University and Benjamin Miner of Western Washington University showing the mysterious symptoms of the Sea Star Wasting Disease\u00e2\u0080\u0094including causing a sea star\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm to walk away from its deteriorating body.

During the study, the team also analyzed preserved sea stars from past decades for viral traces, and found evidence of SSaDV or similar viruses in museum specimens dating back to the 1940s.\n\nBut if SSaDV has been in the wild around all this time, and appears to be a virus that can be freely transmitted in the water column and in sediments, why is it all of sudden a problem now?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot to untangle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to Lafferty, whose USGS research often examines <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I3SzH_7QjIA#t=520\">the role of disease organisms in natural food webs<\/a> and their usefulness <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/envirohealth\/geohealth\/v09_n03.html#v09_n03_Land_Benj_010\">as indicators of ecosystem function<\/a>. \u00e2\u0080\u009cParasites and pathogens are part of the natural food web, and just like wolves or sharks or any other organism, they can be affected by changes in the environment or their prey.
