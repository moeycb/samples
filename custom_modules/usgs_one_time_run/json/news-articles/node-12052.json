The Mountain Pass mine produced REE until it closed in 2002. Additional states with known REE deposits include Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is the first detailed assessment of rare earth elements for the entire nation, describing deposits throughout the United States,&rdquo; commented USGS Director Marcia McNutt, Ph.D. &ldquo;It will be very important, both to policy-makers and industry, and it reinforces the value of our efforts to maintain accurate, independent information on our nation&rsquo;s natural resources. Although many of these deposits have yet to be proven, at recent domestic consumption rates of about 10,000 metric tons annually, the US deposits have the potential to meet our needs for years to come.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>REE are a group of 16 metallic elements with similar properties and structures that are essential in the manufacture of a diverse and expanding array of high-technology applications. Despite their name, they are relatively common within the earth&rsquo;s crust, but because of their geochemical properties, they are not often found in economically exploitable concentrations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hard-rock deposits yield the most economically exploitable concentrations of REE. USGS researchers also analyzed two other types of REE deposits: placer and phosphorite deposits.&nbsp; Placer deposits are alluvial formations of sandy sediments, which often contain concentrations of heavy, dense minerals, some containing REE.&nbsp; Phosphorite deposits, which mostly occur in the southeastern U.S., contain large amounts of phosphate-bearing minerals.&nbsp; These phosphates can yield yttrium and lanthanum, which are also REE.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ninety-six percent of REE produced globally now comes from China. New REE mines are being developed in Australia, and projects exploring the feasibility of economically developing additional REE deposits are under way in the United States, Australia, an","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Minerals","Rare Earth","geolgoy",""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1289970000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168957"},{"tid":"169815"},{"tid":"169844"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
