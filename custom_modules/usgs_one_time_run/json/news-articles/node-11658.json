During the past three years, he worked to establish the USGS-South Dakota State University (SDSU) Geographic Information Science (GIS) Center of Excellence where he is currently Co-Director. As an adjunct faculty member at SDSU, Loveland has taught many courses and advised numerous graduate students.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Loveland was among the first investigators to create continental and global-scale land cover data sets derived from remotely-sensed imagery. Crossing geographic scales again, he presently heads a USGS research team charged with developing a contemporary land cover history of the U.S. based on small sample blocks of remotely-sensed data that are systematically verified in the field.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, Dr. Loveland leads the Landsat Continuity Mission Science Team, a group of scientists and engineers responsible for offering advice and recommendations to the USGS and NASA on issues critical to the successful launch of the next Landsat satellite. A member of the editorial board for the Journal of Land Use Sciences, he has served in leadership roles in a number of national and international science organizations including the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. He is a past member of the NASA National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project science team. He has authored or co-authored over 90 scientific papers, delivered at well over 60 national and international meetings. He has received career achievement awards from the USGS, the Department of the Interior, American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, and the Association of American Geographers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Loveland holds bachelor's and master's degrees in geography from South Dakota State University and a PhD in Geography from the University of California-Santa Barbara. He and his wife, Cam, reside in Sioux Falls, SD.USGS provides science for a changing world.
