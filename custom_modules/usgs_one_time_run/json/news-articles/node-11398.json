Following\r\nrelease of these documents, the high-flow experiment and associated research\r\nactivities will be undertaken on March 4th cooperatively by scientists and\r\nresource managers from Interior's U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Reclamation,\r\nNational Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian\r\nAffairs.<\/p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate \" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\"><span class=\"bold\">Opening a Dam to Study and Improve Resources in the Grand Canyon<\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep30\/20080229_30_Highflow.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | \r\n       <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ID=60\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/> or  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>The 2008 high flow test will\r\nbe similar to the previous high flow experiments conducted by the joint\r\nInterior agencies in 2004, but the amount of sediment available for the 2008\r\nexperiment is considerably larger. Based\r\non the previous experiments, scientists have concluded that more sand is needed\r\nto rebuild sandbars throughout the 277-mile reach of Grand Canyon National Park\r\nthan was available in 1996 or 2004. Currently, sand supplies in the river are\r\nat a 10-year high with a volume about three times greater than in 2004 due to\r\ntributary inflows below the dam over the past 16 months.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the high-flow\r\nexperiment, Reclamation will release water through Glen Canyon Dam's powerplant\r\nand bypass tubes to a maximum amount of approximately 41,500 cubic feet per\r\nsecond (cfs) for about 60 hours. Current\r\noperational plans call for the experimental flows to begin increasing in the\r\nevening on March 4th, with powerplant bypass flows to begin on March 5th.<\/p>\r\n<p>From February 8-22, 2008, Reclamation\r\nsolicited public comments on the environmental assessment. The final environmental assessment and FONSI\r\nconclude that implementation of the preferred alternative &mdash; the March 2008\r\nhigh-flow test and fall steady flow experiment from Glen Canyon Dam &mdash; would\r\nhave no significant impacts on the quality of the human environment or the\r\nnatural resources below the dam.<\/p>\r\n<p>The FEA and FONSI are\r\navailable for review at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usbr.gov\/uc\/envdocs\/ea\/gc\/2008hfe\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">www.usbr.gov\/uc\/en","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Utah"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1204261200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169281"},{"tid":"169228"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
