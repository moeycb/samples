The new video, titled <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/98\/\"><em>The Heat is On: Desert Tortoises and Survival<\/em><\/a>, explains why this important indicator of desert ecosystem health is declining and what scientists are doing to save them.<\/p>\r\n<p>The tortoise is being threatened by habitat loss, off-road vehicle use, utility corridors, predators, wildfire, and disease. Scientists are working to meet the challenge of providing information to reverse trends effecting the habitat and well-being of the tortoise, and to reduce the threat of extinction.<\/p>\r\n<p>Take advantage of this opportunity to interview the scientists whose work is featured in the video.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>USGS Ecologist Todd Esque and Wildlife Biologist Ken Nussear<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>What:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Screening of 30-minute video<br \/> Introduction of video and discussion with the scientists featured in the film <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Thursday, May 27, 2010<br \/> 12:00 noon &mdash;Lecture and video preview for USGS employees and reporters<br \/> 1:00 p.m. &mdash;Media availability for interviews following the lecture &amp; video<br \/> 7:00 p.m. &mdash;Public lecture and video showing <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>U.S. Geological Survey<br \/> Building 3 Auditorium, 2nd-floor<br \/> 345 Middlefield Road<br \/> Menlo Park, California <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Map and Directions:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/online.wr.usgs.gov\/calendar\/map.html\">Menlo Park Science Center Campus Map<\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>A news release providing more information about the video is available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2418\">online<\/a> and the video, along with its transcript, can be viewed <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/98\/\">online<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["biology","tortoise","threatened","Desert","Mojave","video","Nussear","Esque","","Wessells","documentary"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1274760000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
