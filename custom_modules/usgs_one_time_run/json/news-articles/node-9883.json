Moore will review the Mars Pathfinder images and what they tell us about the Red Planet at 4 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 21, in Room 255 of the Convention Center. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Remember the Alamo?\" Not the one in Texas, but the \"Alamo\" impact crater that was created in what is southern Nevada, about 370 million years ago when a comet slammed into the ancestral Pacific Ocean, which covered the area at the time. The splash that was created will be described by Charles A. Sandberg, geologist emeritus of the USGS in Denver, Colo. Sandberg will present his findings at 10:30 a.m., Monday, Oct. 20, in Room 250 of the Convention Center. <\/p>\r\n<p>The \"Really Big\" Impact, \"Chicxulub,\" &mdash; which is believed to have caused extinction of the dinosaurs, will be demonstrated in a computer animation created by Tau Rho Alpha, of the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif. Alpha will demonstrate his newest science-education animation at 9:45 a.m., Tuesday, Oct. 21, in Room 150 of the Convention Center. <\/p>\r\n<p>Lanslide Prone Areas &mdash; throughout the United States are easy to locate on the USGS&rsquo;s new \"Landslide Incidence and Susceptibility Map\" that will be featured at a poster session from 8 a.m. to noon, Wednesday, Oct. 22, in Hall C, Booth 69. Debris Flows &mdash; in areas along the Pacific Coast will be described by Raymond Wilson and Mark Reid of the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif., in a session on the hydrogeology of landslides. The session begins at 8 a.m., Monday, Oct. 20, in Room 259 of the Convention Center. <\/p>\r\n<p>Society Heats Up Over Global Change &mdash; The potential regional scale impacts of climate change will be demonstrated by Robert Thompson, of the USGS in Denver, Colo, with a spatial-resolution model, Wednesday, oct. 22, at 10:30 a.m., in Room 151 of the Convention Center. <\/p>\r\n<p>The Humboldt River - one of the longest \"internally drained\" rivers in the United States, plays an important role in the ecosystem of northern Nevada. Just how important will be explained by David Ponce of the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif., in a poster session from 8 a.m. to noon, Wednesday, Oct. 22, in Hall C, Booth 94. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Editors: Interviews with these GSA presenters may be arranged during the convention by calling the GSA news room at 801-364-6140; or post-convention, by calling the USGS Outreach Office in Denver, Colo., 303-236-5900; or Menlo Park, Calif., 415-329-4000.<\/b> <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"877060800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
