{"title":"USGS and NOAA Install High Tech Equipment to Monitor Canyons for Post-Fire Flash Flood and Debris Flow Hazards","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>\nNews Media are invited to see how new high-tech equipment deployed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will help the public and emergency responders determine flash flood and debris flow hazards in Malibu and other Southern California canyons in the post-wildfire environment.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nReporters will be able to visit streamgage sensors and see how a real-time webcam will be used when storms hit.  USGS and NOAA experts will be on hand to discuss the latest debris-flow hazard maps and new mobile radar detection methods and explain the importance of these new tools to emergency responders, residents and other decision-makers. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nWebcam images will soon be broadcast from Malibu Canyon and data from the real-time streamgage is now available to the public, providing on-line information on conditions in the canyon to anyone with a computer. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>WHAT:<\/strong>  Before the storms begin, see new technology used to provide real-time debris-flow and flood information.  Explore a new USGS streamgage and view images from real-time webcams used to monitor flooding and debris flows in Southern California.  Also there will be information about NOAA&#39;s Smart-R truck.  NWS and USGS contact information for the approaching storm event will be supplied. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>WHEN:<\/strong>  2:00 p.m. on Thursday, January 3, 2008 \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>WHERE:<\/strong> Malibu Bluffs Park on Winter Mesa Street - corner of Pacific Coast Highway 1 (beach side) and Malibu Canyon Road. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>WHO:<\/strong> \r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Susan Cannon and Jonathan Stock, USGS landslide experts <\/li>\r\n\t<li>James Bowers, chief of the USGS California Water Monitoring Program <\/li>\r\n\t<li>Lucile Jones, Coordinator of the USGS Southern California Multi-Hazards Program<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Michael Shulters, Director of the USGS California Water Science Center<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Jayme Laber, senior service hydrologist, NOAA\/ National Weather Service Los<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Angeles<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Eric Boldt , warning coordination meteorologist, NOAA\/NWS Los Angeles<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Dave Jorgensen, NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>\r\nTo access NOAA&#39;s latest local radar information, watches, warnings and forecasts, go to or <a href=\"http:\/\/weather.gov\/losangeles\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/weather.gov\/losangeles<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/weather.gov\/sandiego\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/weather.gov\/sandiego<\/a> \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo access USGS landslide maps and other information go to <a href=\"http:\/\/landslides.usgs.gov\/\">Landslide Hazards Program Web site<\/a>. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo access debris flow and other webcams, go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/ca.water.usgs.gov\">USGS California Water Science Center home page<\/a> and click on &#39;View Webcams&#39; in the upper left of the page. \r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1199336400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170469"},{"tid":"170087"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
