Her work involves digging sediment cores from the bottom of the ocean and sorting through the many tiny forms of life found there. In addition to deep sea coral ecosystems, Demopoulos studies communities in parts of the Gulf where oil naturally seeps up from the seafloor and is in fact a wellspring of life, not a source of damage. Chemosynthetic ecosystems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the ones where food webs are based on chemicals rather than sunlight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tend to have different forms of life, such as tubeworms. Demopoulos was on the November 2010 research expedition which first discovered the damaged corals. Funded by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the agency now known as the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, the goal of that expedition was to gather the basic data needed to construct a scientific understanding of the various undersea ecosystems. \u00c2&nbsp;It was part of a decades-long collaborative effort among federal and university scientists to explore deep sea ecosystems in an effort to provide sound baseline information for governance decisions about how to best balance natural resource use with protection. Demopoulos recalled watching the first images from the damaged site come in from remotely-operated vehicle.

When we got closer, there didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be any secondary colonization, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen in the past on dead coral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fact that no new animals -- such as barnacles or hydroids -- had begun to attach to and grow on the dead corals suggested the coral deaths had been recent, noted Demopoulos. This process, known as secondary colonization, is commonly observed on dead corals, but takes time to occur. After the discovery of the damaged coral, Dr. Charles Fisher from the Pennsylvania State University led a follow-up expedition to more carefully investigate the damage itself, supported by a special National Science Foundation RAPID grant. Fisher worked with Dr. Helen White from Haverford College, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Temple University, USGS and BOEM to assess the damage.
