Streamer is a powerful, yet easy way to explore our major waterways. With a simple map click, anyone can trace rivers and streams from a starting point all the way downstream to where a stream drains. Even more impressive, they can click on a stream and trace all others that drain to that point. Streamer also produces a report that includes a map and information about the people and places encountered along the streams traced.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_194351\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/04\/Streamer-Image-1Belle-Forche-hi-res1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-194351\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/04\/Streamer-Image-1Belle-Forche-hi-res1-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"Belle Forche\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" \/><\/a> Streamer map of an upstream trace from a point on Belle Fourche River in South Dakota extending into Wyoming and Montana.
