This approach estimates the total expected regional resource value of carbon and associated ecosystem services for different combinations of forest and agricultural lands. One objective is to include both the change in ecosystem services based on land-use management and policies that create an incentive to convert agricultural lands into forest and the aggregation of the supplied services into a regional estimate for input into a landscape scale assessment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Monday, 8\/1, 4 p.m. -- ESSEX, 4th Floor (Presentation)<br \/> <strong>Where is the water in the San Pedro River Basin?<\/strong><br \/> <em>Darius Semmens,<\/em> <a href=\"mailto:dsemmens@usgs.gov\">dsemmens@usgs.gov<\/a> <br \/> How are natural and human activities forecasted to change semiarid regions an","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maryland"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Ecosystem","","restoration","","Chesapeake","bay","Everglades","Adaptive Management","climatechange","Sea Level Rise"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1312171200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"},{"tid":"170108"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
