USGS conducts Landsat operations and NASA develops and launches new satellites that meet USGS requirements. In addition to imagery of natural hazard events, Landsat provides valuable data for land use research and advances the Department of the Interior&rsquo;s important role in land remote sensing under the President&rsquo;s National Space Policy. Landsat images are unique in that they provide complete global coverage, they are available for free, and they span nearly 40 years of continuous earth observation. No other satellite imagery has that combination of attributes.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geography","landsat","Climateand Land Use Change Land Remote Sensing"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1309147200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169750"},{"tid":"170333"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
