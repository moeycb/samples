In addition to public health concerns if WNV is introduced to Hawaii, concern exists over its possible impacts on Hawaii\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique native bird species.\u00c2\u00a0 USGS scientists are also evaluating if commercial veterinary vaccines against WNV can be safe and effective in certain endangered and threatened wild bird species.\n\nThe USGS is involved in a range of research projects on WNV including work on various native birds.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Studies at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwrc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center<\/a> have included behavior and ecological <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwrc.usgs.gov\/resshow\/hahn\/wnv.cfm\">research<\/a> involving the Eastern Screen Owls and Brown-headed Cowbirds. \u00c2\u00a0Measuring the effects of WNV on the American Kestrels and other raptors in the wild are underway at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fort.usgs.gov\/default.asp\">the USGS Fort Collins Science Center<\/a>. And studies on the impact of WNV on white pelican colonies are taking place at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npwrc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center.<\/a>\n\n<strong>What are the symptoms of West Nile virus in humans?<\/strong>\n\nAccording to the CDC four out of five people will show no symptoms at all if they are infected with WNV.\u00c2\u00a0 But, if you develop any of the following symptoms, a visit to your doctor may be in order:\n<ul>\n\t<li>High fever, headache and body aches<\/li>\n\t<li>Muscle weakness or vision loss<\/li>\n\t<li>Disorientation, stupor, vomiting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSymptoms may last a few days or several weeks and neurological effects may be permanent.\n\n<strong>What can be done to help prevent West Nile virus in humans?<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173820\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"336\" caption=\"Family picnic invites unwanted mosquito guests.
