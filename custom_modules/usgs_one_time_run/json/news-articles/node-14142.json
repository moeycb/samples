Valley wells that tap confined bedrock were the most likely to contain high levels of methane.<\/p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_1.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_1_tn.JPG\" alt=\" Map of the northeastern U.S. showing the general study area in south-central New York State.\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span class=\"small\">Map of the northeastern U.S. showing the general study area in south-central New York State.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_1.jpg\">High resolution image<\/a>)<\/span><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>The wells were tested in June and July of 2012 to provide baseline data on methane concentrations in groundwater.&nbsp; The <a href=\"http:\/\/ny.cf.er.usgs.gov\/nyprojectsearch\/projects\/LK00-Meth-00.html\">study area<\/a> includes about 2000 square miles and is considered favorable for Marcellus Shale gas resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the water wells tested was located within a mile of existing natural gas wells.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"This study provides baseline water-quality data that will be useful for decision makers, regulators, industry, and stakeholders concerned about water quality,\" said USGS scientist Paul Heisig, who led the study. &nbsp;&ldquo;It also provides a preliminary framework to help characterize the occurrence of methane in south-central New York that can be refined as additional data are collected,&rdquo; said Heisig.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"243\" align=\"left\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_2.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_2_tn.JPG\" alt=\" Map showing the distribution of sampled wells over 5 counties in south-central New York State.\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span class=\"small\">\r\n<p>Map showing the distribution of sampled wells over 5 counties in south-central New York State.&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_2.jpg\">(High resolution image<\/a>)<\/p>\r\n<\/span><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>\"Our testing shows that methane is common in some groundwater wells at the present time.

The samples most likely to contain high methane concentrations were from the valley wells that tap into bedrock groundwater lying beneath glacial clay deposits. More than 50 percent of such samples contained methane at or above the 10-milligrams-per-liter monitoring level. Like a cap on a soda bottle, clay blocks methane gas from escaping into the atmosphere.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"215\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_3.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2013_12_17\/Figure_3_tn.JPG\" alt=\"Schematic representation showing major setting components of groundwater in the study area (valley\/upland, confined\/unconfined, bedrock\/glacial.).\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Methane","Methane In Groundwater","Methane In Water","Methane In Wells","Methane In Private Wells","Methane In Household Wells","Water Groundwater Resources","water","Geographic Areas Northeast","Methane In New York","Methane In","Marcellusshale","hydaulicfracking","Hydraulic Fracturing"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Environmental Health","Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1387256400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"},{"tid":"170243"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
