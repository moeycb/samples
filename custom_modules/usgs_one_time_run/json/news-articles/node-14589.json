For those networks that did have a change, seven times more networks saw increases as opposed to decreases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The analysis was done by the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nawqa\/\">National Water Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA)<\/a> to determine if concentrations of these constituents have increased or decreased significantly from the 1990's to the early 2000's nationwide.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"By providing a nation-wide, long-term, uniformly consistent analysis of trends in groundwater quality, communities can see whether they belong in the group of more than 50 percent which are maintaining their water quality, or within the group of more than 40 percent for which water quality is back sliding,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"Communities in the latter group can decide whether and what action may be warranted to address quality issues so they do not cause concern to human health.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Though chloride, nitrate, and dissolved solids occur naturally in the environment, human activities can cause concentrations to exceed levels that would be found naturally. At high concentrations, these chemicals can have adverse effects on human and environmental health.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>High levels of chloride and dissolved solids in water don't present a risk to human health, but are considered nuisance chemicals that can cause the water to become unusable without treatment because of taste or hardness. Additionally, these chemicals can have adverse effects on ecosystems in streams and rivers when they discharge from the groundwater to these water bodies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Excessive nitrate concentrations in groundwater have the potential to affect its suitability for drinking water. Also, when nitrate-laden water is discharged from groundwater to streams, the nitrate can end up in downstream water bodies, such as the Gulf of Mexico, and cause algal blooms. These algal blooms lead to low oxygen zones, which can be deadly to aquatic life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Chloride, dissolved solids, and nitrate have many sources, including agricultural fertilizers, wastewater disposal, and runoff from salt used for deicing or other chemicals. Understanding changes in groundwater quality may help assess the effectiveness of management practices that have been implemented to control these sources.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"This type of long-term trend analysis is crucial for assessing whether the nation's groundwater is adequately protected from excessive concentrations of these potential contaminants,\" said Bruce Lindsey, lead scientist on the report. \"USGS is uniquely positioned to provide this type of nationally consistent, scientific information to managers at the federal, state, and local level, so that they can make decisions that protect people and the environment.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Though a majority of the well networks tested saw no change, chloride concentrations increased in 43 percent of the well networks from the first decade to the second decade of study. Dissolved solids concentrations increased in 41 percent, and nitrate concentrations in 23 percent of well networks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Although concentrations of these three constituents generally meet their respective EPA drinking water standards or guidelines, the proportion of samples exceeding the limits for nitrate and dissolved solids increased significantly over the decadal period at the national level.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Other important findings include:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The largest increases in chloride concentrations were in urban areas in the","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Water Groundwater Resources","Water National Water Quality Assessment","waterquality","nitrogen","Chloride","dissolvedsolids"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1335758400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168982"},{"tid":"169801"},{"tid":"170152"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
