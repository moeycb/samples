And seismic studies have shown that earthquakes in eastern States are felt over much broader areas and can cause damage many miles from their epicenter.\n\nYou can learn about the earthquake hazards in your area by accessing seismic hazard maps and data from the <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/hazards\/\">USGS Earthquake Hazards Program<\/a>.\n<h4><strong>How can we anticipate and prepare for likely flooding? <\/strong><\/h4>\nUSGS scientists monitor real-time streamflow and water quality for thousands of streams across the Nation. With the <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/wateralert\/\">USGS WaterAlert service<\/a>, you can receive data electronically from streamgage stations when certain thresholds are exceeded.\n\nThe information collected by these gages not only allows individuals and communities to have real-time warnings of flooding, but by providing a long-term record, this information also helps communities to plan for likely future flooding.<strong> <\/strong>\n\nAs the climate and the landscape changes, the historical record is not always a good indicator of what will happen in the future.\n\nTo help prepare for potential flooding, USGS scientists can combine an understanding of how water behaves on the landscape with detailed topographic maps of specific areas to provide cities with <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/flood_inundation\/\">flood inundation maps<\/a> that show which areas would likely flood given specific water levels.\n<h4><strong>What is causing the ocean and soils to become more acidic? <\/strong><\/h4>\nIncreased acidity of the ocean and soils has been linked to damaged ocean food webs and to poor crop sustainability. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2946\">recent study on acidification<\/a> found that it is human activities, such as the mining and burning of coal, the mining and smelting of metal ores, and the use of nitrogen fertilizer, that are making our air, water, and soils more acidic.\n\nTo help policymakers address the problem, researchers also created world maps that are helping to alert policymakers about possible future trends and areas to watch for developing hotspots.\n<h4><strong>How is climate change affecting people in the Arctic? <\/strong><\/h4>\nTo help understand socioeconomic issues of climate change, the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2931\">interviewed<\/a> those with traditional and personal environmental knowledge: Yup'ik hunters and elders in two Alaskan villages.\n\nThe villagers described the changes they have seen and expressed concerns ranging from safety, such as unpredictable weather patterns and dangerous ice conditions, to changes in plants and animals as well as decreased availability of firewood.\n<h4><strong>Are our coastal homes at risk to future storms? <\/strong><\/h4>\nThe El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o conditions of the winter of 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2010 eroded beaches at some sites in California and the Pacific Northwest. But how bad was the damage and what can residents expect in the future?\n\nUSGS <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2849\">erosion studies on the West Coast <\/a>\u00c2\u00a0revealed that the conditions produced by El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o, with above average wave energy and ocean water levels, contributed to unprecedented beach erosion in some areas. As the climate changes, El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o conditions are likely to be more frequent, and these assessments are helping coastal experts to better predict how future climatic patterns will affect the Pacific Coast. With this information, land managers and decision makers can mitigate for possible damage to western coastlines\n<h3><strong>Our Ever-Changing Earth <\/strong><\/h3>\nEarth is ever changing, but through earth and natural science studies, the USGS is helping the Nation to understand our vulnerabilities, to anticipate the impacts, and to mitigate the risks.\n\nLearn more about Earth Science Week <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthsciweek.org\/eventsnearyou\/index.html\">events in your area<\/a>.","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24156","uid":"31","filename":"erosion-roadside.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/erosion-roadside.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"208143","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"aceb75c2-a0e0-4e7e-ab81-a35f4f4ba09d","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":360,"width":620},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Climate Change","erosion","flood","flooding","Natural Hazards"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1318345533","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
