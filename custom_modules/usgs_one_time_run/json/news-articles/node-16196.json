Sediment helps shape the Bay Area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality of life, from its water quality to its coastal beaches to the ongoing restoration of its tidal wetlands. Dams, dredging and a legacy of hydraulic mining have left their marks on the Bay Area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system of \u00e2\u0080\u009csediment transport\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the scientific term for the water-borne movement of sediment from place to place\u00e2\u0080\u0094making <a href=\"http:\/\/walrus.wr.usgs.gov\/coastal_processes\/sfbsm\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> science crucial to charting the potential impacts of future human interventions. Yet the Bay Area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex sediment-transport processes have never before been comprehensively studied on a regional scale.\n\nThe first ever compilation of research focused on sediment transport in the San Francisco Bay coastal system was published in November as a special issue of the journal <em>Marine Geology<\/em>, edited by USGS scientists. The volume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 21 papers from USGS and other research scientists investigate this complex and ever-changing system through the lenses of hydrology, chemistry, ecology and many other disciplines. The authors characterize how water-borne sand and mud affect not just local landforms and hydrology but also environments hundreds of miles away, through the Golden Gate to the Pacific Ocean and beyond. The research will help planners manage resources of benefit to more than 25 million Californians.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe interaction of natural and anthropogenic drivers of sediment transport is highly complex in this heavily urbanized region, and understanding it is critical to the efficient management of sediment resources that affect beaches, tidal-wetland restoration, and sensitive ecosystems throughout the region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patrick Barnard, USGS coastal geologist and managing guest editor of the special issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hope that this special issue will be instrumental in guiding management decisions for years to come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">A History of Sediment<\/span><\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_188461\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"367\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Sed1F1StudyArea1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-188461  \" title=\"Sed1F1StudyArea\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Sed1F1StudyArea1.jpg\" alt=\"The San Francisco Bay Coastal System, including major tributaries.

The sediment changed local landforms by building out Bay shorelines and tidal wetlands, accreting river channels, and adding to the huge, submerged sand bar outside the Golden Gate. This gigantic sediment pulse has taken more than a century to flow through the system. Now that the Gold Rush sediment is on its way out and the water is clearer, scientists are evaluating how the Bay Area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural processes and quality of life will change.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Biological Effects<\/span><\/strong>\n\nSediment influences how hospitable water is to certain organisms. Sediment-laden waters are preferred by some wildlife species, notably the endangered Delta Smelt. In the Bay Area, sediment suspended in bay and delta water has also performed the function of making the water less prone to algal blooms. As the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sediment content has declined in the last couple of decades, its algae count has risen. This phenomenon has been most pronounced in El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o years of heavy rain. Discharges or diversions of water from various parts of California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complex water-resources infrastructure can also affect this\u00c2\u00a0sensitive balance.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_188471\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"384\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/X-60072.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-188471 \" title=\"X-60072\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/X-60072.jpg\" alt=\"Gold miners excavating an eroded bluff with jets of water at a placer mine in Dutch Flat, California, between 1857 and 1870.

Sediment carried through the bay to the Pacific nearshore replenishes beaches eroded by coastal waves. In the far north and south reaches of San Francisco Bay, sediment helps to restore tidal marshes lost to former salt ponds by counteracting local sinking caused by historical groundwater pumping, in effect elevating the ground so that it remains in the tidal zone, where tide-adapted plants and animals thrive. With the giant sediment pulse from hydraulic mining largely past, these processes of replenishment and restoration must now rely on smaller and more localized sediment sources. USGS research aims to chart how sustainable California beaches will be, and how long it will take to restore bay wetlands, in light of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changing sediment budget.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Useful to Land Managers and Planners<\/span><\/strong>\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe information provided in the <em>Marine Geology<\/em> special issue has fundamentally changed the way managers are thinking about the sediment supply to San Francisco Bay and the outer coast, and how we manage projects,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brenda Goeden, Sediment Program Manager of California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bcdc.ca.gov\/\">San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission<\/a>. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, the suspended-sediment research is helping managers understand how sediment supply will affect habitat restoration projects around the Bay that are funded by millions of public dollars, and it offers a rare opportunity to intervene where sediment supply may not support a given restoration site in the face of rising seas. Similarly, the coarse-grained-bedload findings inform policy analysis of projects proposing to extract large quantities of coarse-grained sediment from the Bay system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_188491\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"311\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/IMG_0456-copy.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-188491  \" title=\"IMG_0456 copy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/IMG_0456-copy.jpg\" alt=\"USGS Research Vessel Parke Snavely mapping in Alviso Slough (south San Francisco Bay) in October 2011 to document how the bottom had changed after levees adjacent to the slough were breached in December 2010.

The submerged sand bar outside the Golden Gate alters nearshore waves by refracting or bending their paths, and causing the waves to break as the water gets shallow (shoals). The sand bar is expected to continue shrinking in future decades owing to the combined effects of reduced sediment and projected sea-level rise. This shrinkage, in turn, is likely to alter wave behavior and thus expose the coastline for many miles south to more aggressive and potentially erosive wave action.\n\nStudying sediment transport trains a special lens on San Francisco\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bay, delta and nearshore as part of a fluid and interconnected system. Human intervention has altered the sediment budget and thus the whole environment in ways unforeseen in the 19th century. USGS science aims to understand this changing and complex system to give managers tools to work with future change.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat had previously been a black box for managers is now becoming clearer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Goeden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree cheers for the work that has been so well researched and clearly explained!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_188501\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"343\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Sed5SurfZnF3bTU.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-188501 \" title=\"Sed5SurfZnF3bTU\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Sed5SurfZnF3bTU.jpg\" alt=\"USGS scientists positioning a current profiler on the sandy seabed at Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, in 2006 as part of a study begun in 2004 to investigate sand transport and sedimentation patterns along the beach and the mouth of San Francisco Bay.
