Through satellite and computer technology, streamgages transmit real-time information, which the National Weather Service (NWS) uses to issue warnings so local emergency managers can get people out of harm&#039;s way, and operators of flood-control dams and levees use to take action to reduce flood impacts. Streamgage data also help in designing structures resilient to flooding and are the basis for the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#039;s National Flood Insurance Program, the only Federal insurance program for natural hazards. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS works closely with the NWS, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other Federal agencies and partners in every state, as well as many local governments, to fund and maintain about 7,000 streamgaging stations nationwide.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1151467200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169087"},{"tid":"169811"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
