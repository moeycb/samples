Since that time, the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs for geologic information have grown much more diverse to include, for example, natural and environmental hazards, and human health and safety. At the same time, the need to provide this information to the public quickly and efficiently has become imperative.\n\nIn 1992 the Geologic Mapping Act was enacted by Congress. This Act requires the USGS and the state geological surveys (represented by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stategeologists.org\/\">Association of American State Geologists<\/a>) to build a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnational archive\u00e2\u0080\u009d of standardized geoscience map information, the <a href=\"http:\/\/ngmdb.usgs.gov\/\">National Geologic Map Database<\/a>. As the Act intended, the NGMDB has long served the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s need for quick access to publications, data, and information about the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geology.\n\nSince the NGMDB website debut in 1996, changes in technology and user expectations have been dramatic. The geologic map database primary partners, the USGS and AASG, are pleased to launch a newly redesigned system that is a significant leap forward in terms of the technology and the information now available to the public. The new system improves the integration of publication citations, stratigraphic nomenclature, downloadable content, and unpublished source information, thereby greatly improving public access to this archive of the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geologic knowledge.\n\n<strong>Introducing \u00e2\u0080\u009cMapView\u00e2\u0080\u009d<\/strong>\n\nA significant feature of new site is \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/ngmdb.usgs.gov\/maps\/MapView\/\">MapView<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a visually compelling new interface that uses the latest technology to seamlessly portray the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geologic maps published by the USGS, the state geological surveys, and many others.\u00c2\u00a0 These maps, now available through the NGMDB in several popular and easy-to-use formats, can be viewed in detail and downloaded from the various publishers.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_175513\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/ngmdb.usgs.gov\/maps\/MapView\/\"><img class=\"wp-image-175513 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/11\/ngmdb21-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" \/><\/a> A Google Earth view of the Harper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ferry area (Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia).
