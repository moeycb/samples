The majority of the island is part of Fire Island National Seashore and is a unique and important recreational and ecosystem resource.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a result of Hurricane Sandy, beaches and dunes on Fire Island lost more than half of their pre-storm volume. Field surveys conducted immediately after Sandy documented low, flat beaches and extensive dune erosion. Assessment of overwash deposits -- the material that was carried to the interior of the island -- indicates that most of the sand lost from the beaches and dunes during Hurricane Sandy was moved offshore or down the coast.<\/p>\r\n<p>This website is one of several planned products to connect people with&nbsp;USGS research related to Hurricane Sandy&nbsp;recovery, restoration and rebuilding efforts, many of which are funded by Disaster Relief Appropriations Act 2013, also known as Sandy Supplemental.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Natural Hazards","Natural Hazards Coastaland Marine Geology","Geographic Areas Northeast","Hurricane Sandy","Hurricane","fire","island","New","York","barrier","islands","USGS"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Natural Hazards"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1387256400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169049"},{"tid":"169071"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
