U.S. Geological Survey geologist Judy Fierstein, co-author of a new landmark study on this huge volcanic event, shares her work with the community in a free public lecture Wednesday, June 6, a century to the day after the Novarupta-Katmai Eruption of 1912 began. Today, study of Novarupta and Katmai volcanoes sheds light on how future events in Alaska&rsquo;s volcanic regions could affect air quality and air-transportation safety across the globe.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Judy Fierstein, USGS research geologist <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>What: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Illustrated lecture on \"Exploring the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes: A Centennial Perspective on the Novarupta-Katmai Eruption of 1912\" <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>U.S. Geological Survey Menlo Park Campus, 345 Middlefield Road,<br \/>Menlo Park CA 94025; Building 3 Auditorium, second floor<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Wednesday, June 6, 2012<br \/>Noon preview for USGS employees and reporters<br \/>7 p.m. public lecture (also <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wr.usgs.gov\/calendar\/live.html\">streamed over the Internet<\/a>)<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>More Information<br \/>and Directions: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/online.wr.usgs.gov\/calendar\/\">Lecture Schedule<br \/>Menlo Park Science Center Campus Map<\/a><\/td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California","Alaska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Communicationsand Publishing Science Publishing Network","Natural Hazards Volcano Hazards","Geographic Areas Alaska","Geographic Areas Southwest"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1338782400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168892"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
