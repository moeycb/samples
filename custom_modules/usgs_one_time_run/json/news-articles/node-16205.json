Landsat 8 is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3510#.Uvi55vldVg1\">latest success<\/a> in a decades-long NASA and U.S. Geological Survey partnership that has provided a continuous record of change across Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land surfaces since 1972.\n\nOrbiting 440 miles above Earth, Landsat satellites document natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, glacial retreat, floods, and forest fires, and human processes such as urban expansion, crop irrigation, and forest clear-cutting. Since 2008, all Landsat data are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2347#.UvVO9_ldVg0\">freely available<\/a> to anyone on Earth.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_190771\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"344\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/landsat\/launch\/#.UvkT7PldVg0\"><img class=\" wp-image-190771  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/Landsat8LiftsOff.jpg\" alt=\"Landsat 8 Lifts Off on Feb. 11, 2013\" width=\"344\" height=\"517\" \/><\/a> The satellite was known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission until it was certified by NASA as mission-ready. NASA photo.[\/caption]\n\nThe launch went perfectly, as did NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thorough testing of the satellite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systems. On May 30, NASA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3605#.Uvi4kfldVg0\">transferred the satellite<\/a> to the USGS, which now operates Landsat 8 along with older sister Landsat 7.\u00c2\u00a0 With two Landsat satellites on orbit, the USGS can provide data every eight days for any spot on the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land masses, supporting water managers, agricultural commodities markets, and scientists around the globe.\n\n<strong>National leaders applaud<\/strong>\n\n\"Data produced by Landsat plays a vital role in <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\/?page_id=6724\">managing America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural resources<\/a> and the industries and jobs that rely on those resources,\" said Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that funds NASA and USGS. \"It was Landsat that brought home the severity of Midwest floods in the 1990s, and it has helped identify periods of severe drought that were so devastating to our farmers and foresters. My hat goes off to NASA's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/centers\/goddard\/home\/\">Goddard Space Flight Center<\/a> that has played a key role in building each of the Landsat satellites, including Landsat 8, improving each satellite with the latest technology and help us better understand planet Earth.\"\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor over forty years, the Landsat Program has provided a valuable stream of image data of the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s landscape.\u00c2\u00a0 The newly activated Landsat 8 satellite continues this mission, sending images to the USGS <a href=\"https:\/\/eros.usgs.gov\/\">Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center<\/a> near Sioux Falls, S.D.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe land and water resource data from Landsat 8 is a great asset to agricultural producers and others in both the public and private sectors.\u00c2\u00a0 I salute the professionals at NASA and USGS who have worked to make this resource available for decades, and into the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks to the hard work of many dedicated individuals at both NASA and USGS, today we celebrate the one year anniversary of the launch of the Landsat 8 satellite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThroughout my time in Congress, I have been a proud supporter of the Landsat program, and the USGS EROS Center, which processes Landsat data. The images produced by Landsat satellites are used all over the world as a vital planning tool, allowing researchers to analyze the ways in which land use and management have changed, and giving policymakers important information as they seek to develop sensible economic and environmental policy, including helping to track flooding, wildfires, drought, and other changing environmental conditions. I commend NASA and USGS on reaching this milestone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe 40-year archive of Landsat imagery, propelled into the 21st century by Landsat 8, is a treasure trove of scientific information that can form the basis for a myriad of useful applications. The USGS free data policy makes this treasure available to every person on the planet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the U.S. Department of the Interior.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI congratulate the dedicated scientists, engineers, and support staff at USGS-EROS and NASA Goddard who carefully built a long and successful partnership over many years.\u00c2\u00a0 Commercial enterprises, government scientists and managers, and the academic community can all take advantage of the Landsat data you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made available.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong>Landsat 8 shines in rookie season <\/strong>\n\nStocked with a 10-year supply of fuel, Landsat 8 carries two highly sensitive <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.usgs.gov\/ldcm_vs_previous.php\">observation instruments<\/a>, the Operational Land Imager and the Thermal Infrared Sensor. Advanced technology increases the reliability and sensitivity of these instruments, while the improved measurements are still compatible with the past Landsat data record.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_190781\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/MississippiRiverDelta.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-190781 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/MississippiRiverDelta.jpg\" alt=\"Mississippi River Delta\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> Water flows through the Mississippi River Delta into the Gulf of Mexico. USGS-NASA image acquired by Landsat 8 in September 2013.[\/caption]\n\nThanks to a sustained push by NASA, the USGS, and industry partners, Landsat 8 was operational in time for the 2013 North American growing season and wildfire season.\u00c2\u00a0 Landsat 8 data were immediately put to work in a wide range of decision-support applications, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fhm.fs.fed.us\/\">forest health monitoring<\/a> by the U.S. Forest Service, <a href=\"http:\/\/burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov\/\">burn severity mapping<\/a> by the USGS, NASA, and the National Park Service, and <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\/?page_id=3512\">cropland mapping<\/a> by the National Agricultural Statistical Service.\n\nLandsat 7 and Landsat 8 together collect nearly 1000 images per day, almost double the amount of data collected three years ago when Landsat 5 and 7 were operating together. This increased data collection benefits all Landsat applications, especially in persistently cloudy areas (e.g. humid tropics and high latitudes).\n\nThe USGS data processing system has exceeded expectations, providing images to the public within five hours of the data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival at the USGS EROS. This speedy data delivery has significant benefits for disaster support.\n\nLandsat 8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improved signal-to-noise ratios enable users to identify more subtle changes in the landscape, and the advance from 8- to 12-bit measurement is yielding new uses of Landsat data for snow- and ice-covered regions. Landsat 8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geometric and geodetic accuracy is so good that the USGS now has the means to use Landsat 8 data to significantly improve the geometric accuracy of the entire 4.6 million image Landsat archive.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_190791\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/CapeCodMassachusetts.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-190791 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/CapeCodMassachusetts.jpg\" alt=\"Cape Cod, Massachusetts\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> Cape Cod juts out into the Atlantic Ocean in the northeastern United States.

Australian researchers are finding that the availability of improved Landsat 8 data has enhanced their ability to identify and quantify areas of land degradation or improvement in the extensive Australian outback. Using Landsat 8\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thermal data, Ted Scambos and fellow University of Colorado researchers found <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/content\/goddard\/nasa-usgs-landsat-8-satellite-pinpoints-coldest-spots-on-earth\/#.UvO2tfldVg0\">temperatures in eastern Antarctica<\/a><em> <\/em>that were the lowest surface temperatures ever recorded, several degrees lower than the \u00e2\u0088\u0092128.6\u00c2\u00b0F recorded by ground instruments in 1983.\n\n<strong>A joint effort<\/strong><strong><\/strong>\n\nAs partners in the Landsat program since its <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\/?page_id=2281\">inception in the 1960s<\/a>, USGS and NASA have distinct roles. NASA develops remote sensing instruments and spacecraft, launches satellites, and validates their performance. The USGS then assumes ownership and operation of the satellites, in addition to managing data reception, archiving, product generation, and distribution.\u00c2\u00a0 Both agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Earth science programs use Landsat data heavily for new science and applications.\n\nSince Landsat 8 launched, the USGS EROS Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., have continued their close collaboration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 putting the new satellite through its paces by steering it into its orbit, calibrating its detectors, collecting test images, and certifying the mission for sustained operation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Landsat archive, reaching back across four decades, provides an unprecedented record of land-surface change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said NASA Goddard Director Chris Scolese. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_190801\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/LasVegasNevada.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-190801 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/LasVegasNevada.jpg\" alt=\"Las Vegas, Nevada\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a> The fast growing city of Las Vegas, Nevada is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.
