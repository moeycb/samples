USGS also studies geologic carbon sequestration, the storing of carbon in underground rock formations, and has published a\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1386\/\">national assessment of storage potential<\/a>. This 2013 report estimates a mean of 3,000 metric gigatons of potential carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) storage in the United States.\n\n<strong>Biology at work<\/strong>\n\nCarbon is a part of every living thing. For instance, the human body is about 18% carbon. Carbon is also a part of many non-living things, too \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like air, soil, rocks, the oceans and, famously, pencils and soft drinks.\n\nCarbon moves in natural processes called the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/eros.usgs.gov\/climate-change\/carbon-cycle\">carbon cycle<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0between the atmosphere (air), the biosphere (living things), and the geosphere (land and water). Biologic carbon sequestration is a more specific part of the carbon cycle in which plants naturally take in CO<sub>2<\/sub>\u00c2\u00a0from the atmosphere by way of photosynthesis. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works.\n\nAs plants grow, they accumulate, or sequester, carbon in various ways: in living biomass, in litter on the ground when leaves fall, and in soils when organic material decomposes. At the same time, plants also release carbon as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. While plants live, these carbon releases occur through natural respiration and, when they die, either by natural means (e.g. fire or decomposition) or by human causes (e.g. clear cutting).\n\nWhen the amount of carbon that is accumulated in ecosystems is greater than the amount removed either as emissions to the atmosphere or by physical removal (e.g. for wood products), we refer to this situation as a carbon sink because the rate of sequestration is greater than the rate of removal. The term carbon source applies to the opposite situation when the rate of carbon removal from the ecosystem is greater than the rate of carbon sequestration.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_198351\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/06\/Geologic-Carbon-Sequestration.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-198351 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/06\/Geologic-Carbon-Sequestration-300x220.jpg\" alt=\"Geologic Carbon Sequestration\" width=\"300\" height=\"220\" \/><\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/energy.usgs.gov\/EnvironmentalAspects\/EnvironmentalAspectsofEnergyProductionandUse\/GeologicCO2Sequestration.aspx\">Geologic Carbon Sequestration <\/a>is the storing of carbon in underground rock formations, usually as a pressurized liquid.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">\u00c2\u00a0<\/span>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Science to support climate change policies<\/strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/image\/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf\">Climate Action Plan<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0(June 2013) notes the importance of biological carbon sequestration:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ecosystems are critical to our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy and the lives and health of our citizens.

Forests, which occupy about half the land in the East, accounted for more than 80 percent of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated carbon sequestered annually. They are the largest carbon-storing pools, and have the highest rate of sequestration of the different ecosystem types.\n\nWetlands, including coastal ones, which comprise only about 9 percent of the land cover in the East, account for nearly 13 percent of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estimated annual carbon storage. They also have the second-highest rate of sequestration of all ecosystem types. Nutrients and sediments in rivers and streams flowing from terrestrial environments contribute significantly to the storage of carbon in eastern coastal sediments and deep ocean waters.\n\nThe eastern United States is projected to continue to be a carbon sink (absorbs more carbon than it emits) through 2050, increasing the carbon stored by as much as 37 percent.\u00c2\u00a0 However, the rate of sequestration is projected to slow by up to 20 percent, primarily because of decreases in the amount of forest cover.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"368\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Central_Park#mediaviewer\/File:Southwest_corner_of_Central_Park,_looking_east,_NYC.jpg\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/05\/Southwest_corner_of_Central_Park%2C_looking_east%2C_NYC.jpg\/1024px-Southwest_corner_of_Central_Park%2C_looking_east%2C_NYC.jpg\" alt=\"City &amp; Nature\" width=\"368\" height=\"244\" \/><\/a> The relationship between urban areas and forests is important to biologic carbon sequestration potential[\/caption]\n\n<strong>The national perspective<\/strong> <strong><\/strong>\n\nBased on studies done to date on the lower 48 states, national ecosystems are projected to continue to absorb CO<sub>2<\/sub> through 2050. However, the overall rate of carbon storage could drop significantly, up to 25%, largely due to projected increases in urbanization and agriculture and an increased demand for forest products.\n\nUnder many climate change scenarios, wildfires in the West are expected to increase in number, scope, and intensity, with results that could impact western ecosystems and alter the carbon storage potential. Projections based on IPCC scenarios show greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires in the West could increase 28-56% by 2050.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"270\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/08_14_2013_k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013_2#.U6r6NvmzHB4\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_14_2013\/k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013\/medium\/Fire_Wall.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Fire\" width=\"270\" height=\"151\" \/><\/a> Western wildfires could impact western ecosystems and alter the carbon storage potential.[\/caption]\n\nIn addition, in nearly every scenario global greenhouse gas emissions are projected to continue increasing. Consequently, USGS projections based on future land-use scenarios consistent with the IPCC, show that, by 2050, our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lands would have less sequestration ability to offset increasing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n<strong>Visualizing carbon storage<\/strong>\n\nA new web tool, the \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/landcarbon.org\/\">Land Carbon Viewer<\/a>,\u00e2\u0080\u009d allows users to see the land carbon storage and change in regional ecosystems between 2005 and 2050 in the lower 48 states.
