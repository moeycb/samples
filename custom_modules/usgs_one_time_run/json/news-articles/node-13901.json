Only three species are known to remain, the lake whitefish, round whitefish, and lake herring, and the abundance and distribution of these species are now greatly diminished. The USGS and DEC recently introduced the deep-water form of whitefish, the bloater, into Lake Ontario.<\/p>\r\n<p>Re-establishing populations of native whitefishes in Lake Ontario is the focus of cooperative efforts between USGS, DEC, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, with supporting research conducted by The Nature Conservancy.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>USGS Tunison Laboratory of Aquatic Science<br \/>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>What: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Lake herring stocking into Irondequoit Bay of Lake Ontario <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where: &nbsp;<\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newportyc.org\/\">Newport Yacht Club<\/a> Dock<br \/>694 Seneca Road<br \/>Rochester, NY 14622<br \/>www.newportyc.org <br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Thurs., Dec. 20, 2012<br \/>11a.m.<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>RSVP: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Please contact Holly Muir via the information listed above<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Lake Ontario","Great Lakes Science Center","New York","Fish Restoration","Lake Herring","whitefish","fish","Fish Stocking","Great Lakes","biology"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Biology"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1355893200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169501"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
