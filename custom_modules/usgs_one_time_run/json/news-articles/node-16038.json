Other important objectives included:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Consistent, high quality specifications to produce high resolution copies<\/li>\n\t<li>Each map scanned, as is, to capture the current content and condition of each edition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 age induced yellowing, coffee stains and all<\/li>\n\t<li>Georeferencing the digital maps to allow for basic map analysis and to enable the maps to be imported into Geographic Information Systems so that they could be overlain with other geospatial map data from other sources<\/li>\n\t<li>Archiving the files with the National Archives and Records Administration and the Library of Congress<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/history.html\">The National Program for Topographic Mapping<\/a> began soon after the USGS was established in 1879. On December 4-5, 1884, <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/photos\/j1-john_wesley_powell.jpg\">John Wesley Powell<\/a> addressed the U.S. Congress seeking authorization for the U.S. Geological Survey to begin methodical topographic mapping of the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 Mapping techniques evolved from field surveys through photogrammetry, the process of making maps using aerial photographs, to the computer-based methods currently used. The scales and content of the topographic maps changed as well as the need for more detailed mapping came about.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Much of the colorful history of topographic mapping is portrayed in <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1341\/\">USGS Circular 1341<\/a>, History of the Topographic Branch (Division).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173772\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"368\" caption=\"Oldest USGS Pennsylvania map: 1888 Quakertown, PA 1:62,500-scale topographic map\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/withinthestory-large.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-173772 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/withinthestory-large.jpg\" alt=\"See caption:\" width=\"368\" height=\"452\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Map Changes Over Time<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/edc2.usgs.gov\/pubslists\/factsheets\/fs01502.pdf\">Map scales<\/a> have varied over time.\u00c2\u00a0 Smaller scale maps, showing more area and less detail, were produced first, in the 1800s.\u00c2\u00a0 These maps included the 1:125,000-scale, a 30-minute map covering 30-minutes of latitude and longitude with one inch equaling two miles in distance on the map.\u00c2\u00a0 In the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century the 15-minute, or 1:62,500-scale maps were introduced and users were presented with even more detail.\u00c2\u00a0 The current 7.5-minute, or 1:24,000-scale maps, cover as much as 70 square miles where one inch equals 2000 feet.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/egsc.usgs.gov\/isb\/pubs\/booklets\/symbols\/topomapsymbols.pdf\">Map symbology<\/a> has also changed over time.\u00c2\u00a0 As the need for new symbols arose, some were abandoned, while others were added.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, the electronic trolley car symbol, used frequently during the early part of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century, is non-existent on later maps.\n\nSo far over 155,000 maps have been scanned with only a handful of states remaining.\u00c2\u00a0 The <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/historical\/status\/index.html\">status graphic<\/a>, a visual representation of what maps have been uploaded, is updated frequently. Additional historical documents supporting early topographic mapping will be added to the collection down the road.\n\n<strong>How to Obtain Historical Maps<\/strong>\n\nHistorical topographic maps, as well as current editions may be <a href=\"http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/b2c_usgs\/usgs\/maplocator\/%28xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&amp;layout=6_1_61_48&amp;uiarea=2&amp;ctype=areaDetails&amp;carea=%24ROOT%29\/.do\">viewed and downloaded<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0 for general reference on the <a href=\"http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/b2c_usgs\/b2c\/start\/%28xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&amp;layout=0_1_75&amp;uiarea=1%29\/.do\">USGS Store<\/a> in the GeoPDF\u00c2\u00ae electronic format accessible using \u00c2\u00a0all browsers.
