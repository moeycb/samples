Over the past 25 years, the summer sea ice melt period in the Arctic has lengthened, and sea ice cover has declined dramatically. Since 1985, scientists at the USGS Alaska Science Center have conducted research on polar bears to inform policy makers regarding conservation of the species and its habitat. Ongoing studies are designed to document population responses of polar bears to changing ice conditions and refine models used to project the future status of polar bears worldwide. These studies will provide managers with information needed to develop strategies to assure long-term polar bear survival in a changing ice environment.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/alaska.usgs.gov\/science\/biology\/polar_bears\/\">Learn more<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audios\/408\">Listen to Corecast Who's Your Mama?

Those Endangered Honeycreepers: <\/strong>Climate change and disease threaten many species of Hawaiian honeycreepers, unusual birds that live in high-elevation rain forests on the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii, which are cool enough to limit transmission of the introduced disease, avian malaria. USGS scientists have documented recent dramatic increases in avian malaria on the Alakai plateau on Kauai that could affect recovery of two endangered honeycreepers, the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Akikiki (Kauai creeper) and `Akeke`e (Kauai akepa), and one endangered thrush, the puaiohi (small Kauai thrush). They are continuing to work on projects to determine how some more common native forest birds may be adapting to this disease and whether they hold important keys for long-term conservation of more threatened species.\n\n<strong>In addition, USGS scientists have studied the critically endangered palila<\/strong> for 25 years; this species feeds on the seeds of the m\u00c4\u0081mane, a native tree that is nutritious but toxic to many other vertebrate species. The palila population has declined steadily during the past 8 years, putting the remaining 1,300 birds at very high risk of extinction. USGS biologists have provided much-needed information on palila life history and on developing restoration techniques, including returning palila to portions of their former range. Some of those birds established a breeding colony at the new site, proving the potential value of translocation for reestablishing populations. Much of the recent decline is due to drought, but long-term browsing by introduced sheep has also reduced the ability of the palila\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subalpine woodland habitat to support them. New research will help managers evaluate how vegetation responds to periodic sheep removals.

The western cuckoo, however, has disappeared from the Pacific Northwest and Canada, leaving breeding to occur in isolated areas along rivers in Arizona, California, and New Mexico. Scientists with the USGS and Northern Arizona University studied this bird along the lower Colorado River in Arizona to understand its habitat needs.
