For example, parts of New England recorded their highest annual flows since 1930. At the same time, below normal conditions were prevalent in Texas and other states in the central and southern Great Plains, parts of the Southeast, and Alaska. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;Despite these regional highs and lows, however, streamflow conditions nationwide were relatively typical,&quot; says Harry Lins, hydrologist with the USGS surface-water program. &quot;We expect in any given year that one percent of streamgages will experience a new all-time record high or all-time record low streamflow. In 2006, two percent of streamgages reported new record high streamflow, most of which were in New England, and one percent of streamgages experienced new record lows.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUSGS plans to provide similar summaries every year. Robert Hirsch, Associate Director for Water, said &quot;These types of summaries are very important as they place annual streamflow in a historic context and help to provide insights on whether conditions reflect short-term (year to year or seasonal) hydrologic fluctuations or longer term, more global influences. They reinforce the critical need for a stable streamflow monitoring network over the long term.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis first-ever USGS summary of seasonal, regional, and national streamflow conditions for water year 2006 can be accessed at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/2006summary\/\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/2006summary\/<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>\r\nFor more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in selected streams and rivers across the U.S. The USGS collects data from more than 7,400 streamgages, many of which provide real-time data in 15 minute increments (explore this information at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/<\/a>). The information is routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, and for many recreational activities. \r\n<p>\r\nAccess an even larger variety of USGS data, such as for ground water and water quality, through the National Water Information System Web Interface (NWISWeb), which contains over 1.5 million sites, and averages over 25 million hits per month (log onto at <a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/\">http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/nwis\/<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1168578000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169480"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
