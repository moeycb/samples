The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic; speakers are encouraged to thoroughly explain the subject matter and to define any words or terms that may be unfamiliar. The USGS lecture series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_173492\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"An outbreak of infectious disease among bats on the order of white-nose syndrome is without precedent, and USGS researchers are working diligently to learn more about its impacts and threats to wild bats\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/Screen-shot-2012-02-16-at-4.55.35-PM.png\"><\/a>[\/caption] <strong>Bat White-nose Syndrome:\u00c2\u00a0 There is a New Fungus Among Us<\/strong> Since first discovered in 2007 in\u00c2\u00a0 New York, white-nose syndrome has spread to 16 states, including Virginia and Maryland, and four Canadian provinces.
