Improvements to symbol definitions (color, line thickness, line symbols, area fills), layer order, and annotation fonts are additional features of this latest update. The maps also have transparency for some features and layers to increase visibility of multiple competing layers.<\/p>\n<p>This new design was launched earlier this year and is now part of the new US Topo quadrangles for Arkansas (874 maps) and South Carolina (519 maps), replacing the first edition US Topo maps for those states.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Users in our state are very excited about the three year revision cycle of the US Topo maps,\" said Bill Sneed, the Geospatial Liaison for Arkansas and Tennessee.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"With the Fayetteville Shale activity, our maps are increasing in popularity outside the normal recreational\/hunting community.\"<strong><em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>US Topo maps are updated <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/about.html\">every three years<\/a>.
