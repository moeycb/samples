As part of the project pilot, <em>The National Map<\/em> Corps had 143 volunteers who improved data for more than 6,400 structures in Colorado. The quality of the volunteer data collected met the USGS standards for position, attribution, and completeness.<\/p>\r\n<p>The release of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3545\">19 states last April<\/a> resulted in an increase of 154 new citizen geographers who have contributed their skills and local knowledge to <em>The National Map<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We are excited to open the next series states of our volunteer data project\" said Elizabeth McCartney, the Volunteer Geographic Information Project Leader. \"The response from the original set of states has been encouraging and we hope to have volunteer participation across the entire nation by the end of the year\".<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/confluence\/display\/nationalmapcorps\/Home\">tools on <em>TNM<\/em>Corps website<\/a> explain how a volunteer can edit any area, regardless of their familiarity with the selected structures.<\/p>\r\n<p>The citizen geographers\/cartographers who participate in this program will make a significant addition to the USGS's ability to provide accurate information to the public. Data collected by volunteers become part of <em>The National Map<\/em> structures dataset which is available to users free of charge.<\/p>\r\n<p>To show appreciation of our volunteer's efforts, <em>The National <\/em><em>Map<\/em> Corps has instituted a <a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/vgistructures_rewards.html#NMCorps\">recognition program<\/a> that awards \"<a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/Rewards\/Rewards_System\/Reward_Categories\/Reward_Categories.htm\">virtual\" badges<\/a>\" to volunteers. The badges consists of a series of antique surveying instruments ranging from a surveyor's chain (25 &ndash; 50 points) to the yet to be achieved theodolite (2000+ points). Additionally, volunteers are <a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/Rewards\/Rewards_System\/Reward_Categories\/Reward_Categories.htm\">publically acclaimed<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>In a recent development, the 4-H National Headquarters has announced that this year's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.4-h.org\/4-h-national-youth-science-day\/\"><em>4-H National Youth Science Day<\/em><\/a> planned for October 9, 2013 will feature geographic technology projects that are part of <em>The National Map<\/em> Corps data collection efforts.<\/p>\r\n<p>Becoming a volunteer for <em>TNM<\/em>Corps is easy; go to <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/TheNationalMapCorps\/index.html\"><em>The National Map<\/em> Corps website<\/a> to learn more and to sign up as a volunteer.
