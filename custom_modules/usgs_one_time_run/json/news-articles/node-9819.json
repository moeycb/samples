Homeowners in the path of the storm check their insurance policies and their shutters, vacationers decide to head inland or take their chances at the beach--and all over the U.S. Geological Survey, people get busy. Before, during, and after, the USGS helps hurricane-prone areas by providing detailed maps of the affected areas to rescue and recovery workers, by tracking flooding, and by documenting coastal erosion. <\/p>\n<p>As Hurricane Fran approaches the United States, the USGS Emergency Response Team is on alert. One of their first priorities is providing maps of the affected areas to emergency response personnel from local, state, and federal agencies. The task is hard--it takes roughly 55,000 quadrangle maps to cover the United States and its territories, not including Alaska. Just finding adequate supplies of the right maps for Hurricane Alley along the East and Gulf Coasts, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands could be challenging. <\/p>\r\n<p>Most map requests will come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Defense Mapping Agency. \"We rely on the USGS maps to give us the information we need in a disaster situation,\" says Greg Millett, of the American Red Cross National Disaster Operations Center. \"The large format of the 1:100,000-scale maps helps us plot the boundaries of a disaster and determine how many households are involved, so we know how much food, clothing, and shelter will be required. The USGS maps contain all the information we need, and they&rsquo;re not cluttered up with extraneous information on landmarks and attractions that most commercial road maps carry.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>While the first maps are being distributed, USGS flood crews are also at work. USGS hydrologists cooperate with other Federal agencies, particularly FEMA, to collect data on storm surges (abnormally high tides caused by storm winds) and river flooding. Surprisingly, during many hurricanes, flooding causes more damage than high winds. The USGS national network of streamflow gaging stations provides data on river stages and discharges to the NOAA\/National Weather Service in real time for forecasting floods.

Damage can reach far from the actual landfall--in October 1995, Hurricane Opal devastated barrier islands in Louisiana 300 miles from its landfall. <\/p>\r\n<p>Depressing as these statistics are, they are vital information for coastal planners and managers as well as property owners. USGS studies in the Pacific Ocean have shown that overwash damage to coasts depends on the shape of the offshore area. \"When we know the coastal profile, the shoreline cities can establish a reasonable construction set-back to prevent unnecessary property losses,\" said Bruce Richmond, a USGS geologist who has specialized in storm effects on the islands of the Pacific. \"We can&rsquo;t prevent hurricanes, but geologic mapping in areas where storms are frequent can help minimize losses by identifying the locations that are most likely to suffer.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>A new method developed at the USGS by Dr. Christopher Barton and colleagues enables scientists and managers to more accurately forecast the size and number of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods, and their consequent losses. \"Such disasters are complex phenomena whose size and frequency show statistically similar behavior,\" said Barton. \"This provides a basis for using a database of small, frequent events to estimate the probability of occurrence of larger, less frequent events.\" The tea","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"841896000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169822"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
