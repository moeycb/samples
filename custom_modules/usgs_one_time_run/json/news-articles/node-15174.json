The latest highway, road and street data from <a href=\"http:\/\/here.com\/abouthere\/?lang=en-US\">HERE<\/a> has been added to the 1,476 revised US Topo quadrangles for the state.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"HERE, a Nokia business, is proud to provide fresh, robust and comprehensive map content to the State of Utah and the US Topo Maps program,\" said Roy Kolstad, VP Sales Enterprise Americas, HERE. \"We are excited for users to experience the benefits HERE brings with our more than 25 years of experience in cartography, drawing on more than 80,000 sources of data.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The new maps also include <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalatlas.gov\/articles\/boundaries\/a_plss.html\">Public Land Survey System (PLSS)<\/a>. These data are added to the growing list of states west of the Mississippi River. PLSS is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States. All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by this rectangular system of surveys, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Other selected states will begin getting PLSS map data during the next respective <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/faq\/?q=categories\/9797\/3579\">revision cycle<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The new design for <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/index.html\">US Topo maps<\/a> improves readability of maps for online and printed use, while retaining the look and feel of the traditional USGS topographic map. Map symbols are easy to read when the digital aerial photograph layer imagery is turned on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Other re-design enhancements and new features:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New shaded relief layer for enhanced view of the terrain<\/li>\r\n<li>Military installation boundaries, post offices and cemeteries<\/li>\r\n<li>New road classification<\/li>\r\n<li>A slight screening (transparency) has been applied to some features to enhance visibility of multiple competing layers<\/li>\r\n<li>New PDF legend attachment<\/li>\r\n<li>Metadata formatted to support multiple browsers&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>US Topo maps are created from geographic datasets in <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/\"><em>The National Map<\/em><\/a><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">,<\/span><\/em> and deliver visible content such as high-resolution aerial photography, which was not available on older paper-based topographic maps. The new US Topo maps provide modern technical advantages that support wider and faster public distribution and on-screen geographic analysis tools for users.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new digital topographic maps are PDF documents with geospatial extensions (GeoPDF<sup>&reg;<\/sup>) image software format and may be viewed using <a href=\"http:\/\/get.adobe.com\/reader\/\">Adobe Reader<\/a>, available as a no-cost download.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>US Topo maps are updated <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/about.html\">every three years<\/a>. The initial round of the 48 conterminous state coverage was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3402\">completed in September of 2012<\/a>.&nbsp; Hawaii and Puerto Rico maps have recently been added. More than 400 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3681\">new US Topo maps for Alaska<\/a> have been added to the USGS Map Locator &amp; Downloader, but will take several years to complete the vast state.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To download US Topo maps: <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/\">http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"805\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_03_25\/UT_Moab_March_2014.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_03_25\/UT_Moab_March_2014_tn.jpg\" alt=\"caption below\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_03_25\/UT_LaSalle_1885_March_2014.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_03_25\/UT_LaSalle_1885_March_2014","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Utah"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Core Science Systems National Geospatial","topographic Map","Topo Maps","digital Topographic Map","Digital Topo Maps","Topographic Data","topographic Map","Topographic Maps","Topo","Utah","Quadrangle","","The National Map"],"distribution":["Mapping"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1395720000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169911"},{"tid":"168937"},{"tid":"170049"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
