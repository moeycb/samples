In eastern and southern Wisconsin, all streams studied had potentially toxic chloride concentrations during winter, with lingering effects into the summer at some streams. Nationally, samples from fifty-five percent of streams studied in 13 northern cities were potentially toxic; twenty-five percent of the streams had samples that exceeded acute water quality criteria. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Toxicity was measured by direct testing of organisms in samples during the local study component; in the regional and the national study components, observed chloride levels were used to assess potential toxicity.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;While winter driving and walking safety are the priority in treating pavements, this study suggests the need for advancements that will reduce salt loads to surface waters without compromising safety,&rdquo; said Matthew C. Larsen, USGS Associate Director for Water.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We expected to see elevated chloride levels in streams near northern cities during the winter months,&rdquo; said Steve Corsi of the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center. &ldquo;The surprise was the number of streams exceeding toxic levels and how high the concentrations were,&rdquo; said Corsi, who led the study.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This study shows that chloride contamination of urban streams is a problem in many places; it&rsquo;s not just a Milwaukee problem,&rdquo; said Corsi.<\/p>\r\n<p>While road deicing accounts for a significant portion of salt applications, it is not the only source. Salt is also used by many public and private organizations and individuals to deice parking lots, walkways and driveways.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Key Findings: <br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Nationally: <\/strong>During the winter, samples from fifty-five percent of northern streams in this study had chloride levels that exceeded USEPA chronic water-quality criteria, indicating potential toxicity. &nbsp;Samples from twenty-five percent of the streams exceeded acute water-quality criteria.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Regionally: In eastern and south-central Wisconsin, potential toxicity was found during winter at all urban streams studied, with lingering effects at some streams in the summer. <br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>During winter, 100 percent of the streams monitored had chloride levels that exceeded the USEPA chronic water quality criteria with fifty-five percent of samples exceeding acute water quality criteria. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>Chloride levels higher than 10,000 milligrams per liter were observed at times during winter deicing periods&mdash;much greater than the chronic water-quality criteria of 230 milligrams per liter and the acute criteria of 860 milligrams per liter.<\/li>\r\n<li>Chloride levels increased as urbanization percentage in the watershed increased. <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><strong>Locally:&nbsp; In Milwaukee, more than half of the samples collected from streams during winter deicing periods were toxic. <br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Samples from seven of 13 streams collected during 2007 deicing periods were toxic in bioassay tests.<\/li>\r\n<li>Chloride levels in 12 out of these 13 streams exceeded USEPA chronic water quality criteria; eight of 13 exceeded acute criteria. <\/li>\r\n<li>In long-term testing of one Milwaukee stream between 1997 and 2008, seventy-two percent of 38 samples collected during the winter were toxic in bioassay tests. <\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>The Wisco","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","aquaticecosystem","stream","deicing","runoff"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1283313600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169801"},{"tid":"170489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
