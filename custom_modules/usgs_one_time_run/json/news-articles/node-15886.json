USGS is tracking seabirds using satellite transmitters to determine their migration corridors in relationship to proposed wind energy areas, and to determine the potential impacts on seabirds of underwater noise from construction of wind energy areas. USGS, in partnership with other federal agencies, is building seabird distribution models based on historic survey data covering over 60 different seabird species, like puffins and petrels, to identify areas with higher and lower use by season.

The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic; speakers are encouraged to thoroughly explain the subject matter and to define any words or terms that may be unfamiliar. The USGS lecture series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/11\/Feature-Image.jpg\"><\/a>Demands for alternative energy are increasing, and offshore wind projects are slated for several Atlantic coast areas.
