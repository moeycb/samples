The new population appears to be spreading from its likely point of origin in the western part of the island around the city of Mayag&uuml;ez. In the last year alone, more than 150 boas have been found in the wild on the island.<br \/><br \/>The established boa constrictor population likely originated with the pet trade. Genetic studies conducted by the researchers indicate that individual boas on the island are highly related and that the population probably originated with a small number of snakes. First-hand accounts from local officials suggest that newborn boas were released in Mayag&uuml;ez in the early 1990s.<br \/><br \/>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Puerto Rico"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["ecosystems Ecosystems Invasive Species Geographic Areas Southeast Boa Constrictor"],"distribution":["Biology"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1354165200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169472"},{"tid":"170369"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
