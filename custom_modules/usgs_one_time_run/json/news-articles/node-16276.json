On Oct. 25, the lava flow crossed an outlying road and inundated a cemetery about half a mile from P\u00c4\u0081hoa Village Road, and is now moving through privately owned properties in this mostly rural community. The flow threatens to cross Highway 130, blocking off access for more than 8000 residents of the Puna District on the Island of Hawai\u00ca\u00bbi.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"790\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\/multimedia\/uploads\/multimediaFile-896.jpg\"><img class=\"     \" src=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\/multimedia\/uploads\/multimediaFile-896.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"790\" height=\"593\" \/><\/a> Lava crossed Apa\u00ca\u00bba Street above P\u00c4\u0081hoa, Hawaii, on Oct 25, 2014. The flow is moving from right to left, with breakouts of lava along the margin of the flow burning asphalt and creating black smoke. A utility pole, far right, was surrounded by lava, but protective insulation and a cinder\/cement barrier around the pole kept it from burning through. The subsurface part of the pole was burned by the heat of the flow, causing the pole to drop vertically by a few feet, but the pole was still standing as of Oct. 31.[\/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"790\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\/multimedia\/uploads\/multimediaFile-930.jpg\"><img class=\"     \" src=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\/multimedia\/uploads\/multimediaFile-930.jpg\" alt=\"Lava\" width=\"790\" height=\"593\" \/><\/a> Lava near the leading edge of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cJune 27th\u00e2\u0080\u009d flow oozed over a concrete slab and toward a tangerine tree before solidifying on the afternoon of Oct.30.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>A Long, Continuous Eruption<\/strong>\n\nThe Pu\u00e2\u0080\u0098u \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00c5\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00c5\u008d vent on the East Rift Zone of K\u00c4\u00ablauea Volcano began erupting on January 3, 1983, and has continued erupting essentially nonstop for more than 31 years. The majority of lava flows have advanced to the south, but over the past two years, lava flows have issued from the vent toward the northeast.

The advance rate of the June 27th flow has varied significantly during the past months and weeks. As of Oct. 31, 2014, the leading edge of the flow is stalled about 155 meters (170 yards) from P\u00c4\u0081hoa Village Road.

The dotted blue lines show steepest-descent paths (the anticipated paths where lava was most likely to move). Flow inflation over several days lifted the flow surface higher than the original topography in the area, affecting the eventual path the lava followed.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>The Role of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory<\/strong>\n\nUSGS\/HVO is monitoring all aspects of the volcanic eruption, including precise mapping of the flow front, measuring lava flow advance rates, measuring tilt and inflation of the volcano itself, analyzing gas emissions, recording earthquakes, and analyzing infrared thermal and webcam images of the eruption. Frequent helicopter overflights track the active flow, lava tube, and the Pu\u00e2\u0080\u0098u \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00c5\u008c\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00c5\u008d vent.
