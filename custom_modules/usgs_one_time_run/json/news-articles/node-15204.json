Activity may stay at this stage for a long time before any eruption. When a volcano is ready to erupt, it will give multiple warning signs.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS CVO and Pacific Northwest Seismic Network work to improve eruption forecasting and warning capabilities for Cascade volcanoes as part of the National Volcanic Early Warning System.&nbsp; They continue to monitor Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Range for signs of unrest.&nbsp; The monitoring network operated by USGS and PNSN enhances the likelihood of detecting preliminary signs of an impending eruption at Mount St. Helens at its earliest stages.&nbsp; Efforts are underway to establish similar networks for the four other active volcanoes in Washington &mdash;Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Glacier Peak, and Mount Baker.<\/p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/observatories\/cvo\/\">USGS CVO website<\/a> has information about Volcano Preparedness Month events, as well as the USGS volcano-monitoring program, the new analysis of Mount St. Helens, and the hazards posed by the other volcanoes in Washington State.&nbsp; Register for weekly updates and occasional Information Statements from the <a href=\"http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/observatories\/cvo\/cvo_volcano_updates.html\">USGS Volcano Notification Service.<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>Washington&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emd.wa.gov\/hazards\/haz_volcano.shtml\">EMD web site<\/a> contains information on the state&rsquo;s volcanoes as well as volcano preparedness measures.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Washington DNR&rsquo;s Division of Geology and Earth Resources produces <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dnr.wa.gov\/ResearchScience\/Topics\/GeologicHazardsMapping\/Pages\/volcanoes.aspx\">maps, assessments, and other information<\/a> to inform landowners, residents, community leaders and emergency personnel about the risks related to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dnr.wa.gov\/ResearchScience\/Topics\/GeosciencesData\/Pages\/geology_portal.aspx\">volcanoes, lahars<\/a>, and other natural hazards in Washington State.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["volcano","hazard","Volcano Preparedness Month","Preparedness","Emergency Management","Cascades","Mount St Helens"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Natural Hazards"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1399348800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168947"},{"tid":"169006"},{"tid":"170059"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
