Does its use present a risk to human health?\n\nResults from a new study by researchers from Baylor University and the USGS indicate that living adjacent to a coal-tar-sealed pavement is associated with significant increases in estimated excess lifetime cancer risk, and that much of the increased risk occurs during early childhood.\n\n<strong>What are sealcoat, coal tar, and PAHs?<\/strong>\n\nPavement sealcoat\u00e2\u0080\u0094also called sealant or driveway sealer\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a black liquid sprayed onto the asphalt pavement of many residential driveways, parking lots, and even some playgrounds. Sealcoat used in the central, southern, and eastern U.S. commonly contains coal-tar pitch, and sealcoat used in the western U.S. commonly contains asphalt.\u00c2\u00a0 Coal-tar pitch, the residue remaining after distillation of coal tar (a byproduct of the coking of coal), is a known human carcinogen and contains about 200 different PAHs. \u00c2\u00a0Coal-tar-based sealcoat typically is 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch and contains from 50,000 to 100,000 milligrams per kilogram (or parts per million) PAHs, about 1,000 times higher than PAH concentrations in asphalt-based sealcoat products, and hundreds of times higher than PAH concentrations in tire particles, used motor oil, or other urban sources. At least seven PAHs, including benzo[<em>a<\/em>]pyrene, are probable human carcinogens.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176183\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176183 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/2-300x112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"112\" \/><\/a> The pavement of many parking lots is coated with coal-tar-based sealcoat, which is marketed to increase the longevity of the underlying asphalt and improve appearance. Car tires grind the dried sealcoat to a fine powder that is a potent source of polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The sealcoat particles wash down storm drains, are blown onto adjacent soil and pavement, and are tracked into homes on the soles of shoes.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>PAHs from coal-tar sealcoat find their way into soil and house dust<\/strong>\n\nFriction from vehicle tires grinds pavement sealcoat into small particles, which are incorporated into the dust on the pavement surface.\u00c2\u00a0 Dust on coal-tar-sealed pavement contains PAHs at concentrations that are hundreds of times higher than those in dust on concrete or unsealed asphalt pavement.\u00c2\u00a0 Some of that contaminated dust is transported by wind, rain, and snowplows to nearby soil, and some is tracked into homes, where it becomes part of the house dust.\n\n<strong>People, especially children, are exposed to PAHs in soil and housedust<\/strong>\n\nWe all consume soil and dust through what is called incidental (non-dietary) ingestion, which occurs when we put our hands or objects into our mouths.\u00c2\u00a0 Incidental ingestion is a pathway to exposure to many chemicals, especially for children.\u00c2\u00a0 The study focuses on incidental ingestion of the seven cancer-causing PAHs.\u00c2\u00a0 A single number known as the benzo[<em>a<\/em>]pyrene equivalent (BaPEQ) was determined that represents the cancer-causing concentration of the seven PAHs combined.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Using existing data, a representative BaPEQ was determined for soil adjacent to coal-tar-sealcoated pavement and for house dust in nearby residences, and also for soil adjacent to unsealed asphalt pavement and house dust in nearby residences.\u00c2\u00a0 The average estimated lifetime BaPEQ dose for someone living adjacent to coal-tar-sealcoated pavement was 38 times greater than for someone living adjacent to unsealed asphalt pavement.\u00c2\u00a0 About one-half of that dose occurs during childhood, that is, 0 to 6 years of age.\n\n<strong>Estimated lifetime cancer risk is substantially higher for people that live near coal-tar-sealcoated pavement<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176184\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176184\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/3-300x241.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"241\" \/><\/a> USGS researchers collect a sample of dust from a sealed parking lot for analysis of PAHs.[\/caption]\n\nExcess lifetime cancer risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094the probability that an individual will develop cancer by age 70 because of exposure to a contaminant\u00e2\u0080\u0094was determined for individuals who spend their lifetime living adjacent to pavement with coal-tar-sealcoat (for example, a sealcoated driveway or a sealcoated parking lot), those who spend just the first 6 years of their life living adjacent to pavement with coal-tar-sealcoat, and those who spend their lifetime (70 years) living adjacent to unsealed asphalt pavement (urban background exposure).\n\nFor someone who spends their entire lifetime<strong> <\/strong>living adjacent to coal-tar-sealcoated pavement, the average excess lifetime cancer risk is estimated to be 38 times higher than the urban background exposure.\u00c2\u00a0 More than one-half of the risk occurs during the first 18 years of life, and most of it (84 percent) is from ingestion of soil.\u00c2\u00a0 The estimated lifetime cancer risk also is elevated for someone who spends just the first 6 years of their life living adjacent to coal-tar-sealed pavement\u00e2\u0080\u0094about 25 times higher than urban background exposure.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_176185\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176185 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/03\/4-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> A USGS researcher vacuums up a sample of house dust for analysis of PAHs.
