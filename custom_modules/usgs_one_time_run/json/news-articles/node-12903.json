The largest potential by far is in the Coastal Plains region, which accounts for 1,900 metric gigatons, or 65 percent, of the storage potential.&nbsp; Two other regions with significant storage capacity include the Alaska region and the Rocky Mountains and Northern Great Plains region.<\/p>\r\n<p>Technically accessible storage resources are those that can be accessed using today's technology and pressurization and injection techniques. The most common method of geologic carbon storage involves pressurizing CO<sub>2<\/sub> gas into a liquid, and then injecting it into subsurface rock layers for long-term storage.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Today's assessment from the USGS is just the latest example of how the Department of the Interior is applying rigorous, peer-reviewed science to some of our nation's most complex land- and resource-management challenges,\" said Deputy Secretary David J. Hayes. \"Nowhere is this more important than the issue of climate change, and today's new research adds to the USGS's groundbreaking work in biological carbon sequestration to better inform our carbon reduction efforts.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This assessment goes further than all previous assessments in considering the viability of sequestration.&nbsp; For example, all areas with groundwater sources that are considered freshwater by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards were eliminated from consideration for carbon storage resource potential in this assessment. &nbsp;In addition, the rock layers included in the assessment were limited to those determined to have sufficient natural seals to prevent CO<sub>2<\/sub> from escaping.&nbsp; This assessment also focused only on rock layers located at depths at which CO<sub>2<\/sub> would stay under sufficient pressure to remain liquid.<\/p>\r\n<p>The study did not evaluate economic viability or accessibility due to land-management or regulatory restrictions for geologic carbon sequestration within these basins.<\/p>\r\n<p>The assessment is also the first geologically based and probabilistic assessment, estimating a range of 2,300 to 3,700 metric gigatons of CO<sub>2<\/sub> storage potential across the United States. For comparison, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that in 2011, the United States emitted 5.5 metric gigatons of energy-related CO<sub>2<\/sub>, while the global emissions of energy-related CO<sub>2<\/sub> totaled 31.6 metric gigatons.&nbsp; Metric gigatons are a billion metric tons.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Today's climate challenges require new, scientifically supported solutions like storing the carbon dioxide created by use of fossil fuels, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere,\" said Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Anne Castle. &nbsp;\"This new study provides the scientific underpinning needed to better manage&nbsp;options related to reducing emissions that contribute to climate change.\"<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Energyand Minerals Energy Resources","Carbon Sequestration","Geologic Carbon Sequestration","Climate Change","Carbon Dioxide","National Assessmentof Carbon","assessment"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1372219200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168777"},{"tid":"169631"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
