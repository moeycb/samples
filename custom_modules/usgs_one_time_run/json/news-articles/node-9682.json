Sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the broadcast will be shown in the USGS Auditorium at noon EDT. <\/p>\n<p>GIS (geographic information system) technology has become an important tool that enables public health professionals to better understand health issues they encounter every day. Computer-assisted GIS programs allow the visual layering of health, demographic, environmental and other data sources. Based on the location of the data on the Earth&rsquo;s surface, many types of data can be analyzed separately and in combination according to their spatial relationships. GIS applications can serve a wide range of purposes in public health research. <\/p>\r\n<p>The 2\u00c2\u00bd hour broadcast seminar will provide information on essential GIS concepts and terminology, entering data into a GIS, issues regarding the use of GIS in public health applications, and examples of GIS applications in public health. The program will feature a live question and answer session, during which participants nationwide can ask instructors questions via toll free telephone lines, by fax, or via TTY lines. Continuing education credits will be offered for various professions. <\/p>\r\n<p>There is no cost to register or view the program, but registration is required to support coordination of this national endeavor.
