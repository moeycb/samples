In the scenario, the earthquake would kill 1800 people, injure 50,000, cause $200 billion in damage, and have long-lasting social and economic consequences.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ground motion simulations and comparisons were performed through a collaboration with the<\/p>\r\n<p>Southern California Earthquake Center, funded by the National Science Foundation.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can check out Dr. Hudnut's interview in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=73\">episode 73 of CoreCast<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\"><\/a>.
