CHIRPS data can be incorporated into climate models, along with other meteorological and environmental data, to project future agricultural and vegetation conditions.\n\n<strong>Drought applications<\/strong>\n\nExplicitly designed for drought monitoring, CHIRPS is already being used to identify possible hot spots of food insecurity. Much of East Africa is still recovering from a series of poor rainy seasons in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012. Food prices remain high, especially in South Sudan, where civil war has led to the displacement of more than a million refugees.\n\nKenya relies heavily on highly productive farms located in the Rift Valley by Lake Victoria where abundant spring rains usually support high crop yields that feed millions of people. This year, however, the CHIRPS dataset has identified a very poor start to the growing season. CHIRPS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 long historical record indicates that this April\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rainfall was the lowest in 34 years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about two inches for the entire month, less than a third of the long-term monthly average (Fig. 1). This information has been passed along to the US Agency for International Development (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usaid.gov\/\">USAID<\/a>) Famine Early Warning Systems Network (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fews.net\/east-africa\/kenya\">FEWS NET<\/a>) , prompting on-the-ground assessments of potential crop failure.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_195691\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"945\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/05\/Rift-Valley-fig-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-195691  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/05\/Rift-Valley-fig-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rift Valley Figure 1.\" width=\"945\" height=\"449\" \/><\/a> Figure 1.

Note 2014.[\/caption]\n\nIn addition to providing high resolution, near real-time information to support early warning, USGS and UCSB scientists are also using the CHIRPS data to explore recent trends in rainfall. This information can help guide \u00e2\u0080\u0098climate smart\u00e2\u0080\u0099 development. It can also help water managers, hydro-electric power companies, natural resource managers, and disaster relief agencies to prepare for a changing climate.\n\n<strong>Potential correlations across oceans<\/strong>\n\nLong-term rainfall has been declining across both the southwestern U.S. and eastern East Africa. Figure 2 shows the 1981-2013 correlation with a linear trend in March-August CHIRPS precipitation for the United States and East Africa. Red areas in these maps denote places where rainfall has been decreasing. Blue areas indicate places where rainfall has been increasing.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_195711\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"1024\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/05\/CHIRPS_R_US_and_EA.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-195711\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/05\/CHIRPS_R_US_and_EA-1024x388.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2. \" width=\"1024\" height=\"388\" \/><\/a> Figure 2.
