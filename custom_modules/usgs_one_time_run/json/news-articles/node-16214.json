The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/\">Federal Emergency Management Agency<\/a>, or FEMA, uses these images to help identify where they should launch a new flood study. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ready.gov\/floods\">Flood studies<\/a> determine how prone different neighborhoods are to floods of a certain intensity or likelihood.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zRfIAKNuLbk\"><strong>Video of FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of Landsat data<\/strong><\/a><strong><em> <\/em><\/strong>(3:10)\n\nSuccessful flood studies require an arsenal of tools, however, including data on river flows and storm tides, hydrological and hydraulic analysis of landscape and river systems, and historic rain data, to name a few.\n\nThese studies have adding satellite data from Landsat to the toolkit. With its archive of images capturing sprawling cities and new developments, Landsat helps FEMA track how building and construction is impacting an area's landscape.\n\nEarth-observing Landsat satellites have been capturing images of the planet's surface since 1972. Landsat 8, the newest satellite in the joint <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\/\">NASA<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> program, was launched Feb. 11, 2013, and now collects more than 400 images per day. New and archived Landsat data are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2076&amp;from=rss#.Uywe7vmwKyc\">available free<\/a> to the public from USGS.

Using satellite imagery, NUCI detects if an area has undergone a human-induced change over a 25-year period.\n\nUrbanization can spell trouble for flood risk.\n\n\"If you identify areas where urban change is accelerating, there are consequences,\" said Zack Roehr, a senior spatial analyst with Dewberry, Fairfax, Va., a FEMA subcontractor. \"The ground is no longer able to hold water, which means local flooding sources are going to receive more of that water. The flooding characteristics are going to change.\"\n\nSoil typically acts like a sponge, absorbing water from rainfall. With urbanization, often the lots that previously had natural landcover, with its ability to absorb some of the rainfall through infiltration, are now covered with concrete or other impermeable material. This change decreases infiltration of rain water into the ground and increases the amount of water that flows to streams and rivers, thereby increasing flood risk.\u00c2\u00a0 Additionally, urbanization results in increased connectivity of the drainage system, which makes for faster runoff from rain storms into creeks and rivers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Selected Landsat Imagery <\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/eros.usgs.gov\/views-news\/austin-texas-growing\">Austin, TX<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 accelerated urban change\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/remotesensing.usgs.gov\/gallery\/gallery.php?cat=3#279\">Washington, DC<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 40 years of change\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/remotesensing.usgs.gov\/gallery\/gallery.php?cat=2#336\">Colorado flooding<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sept. 2013\n\n<strong>Learn more<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Landsat<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\/\">NASA Landsat<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/floods\/resources\/\">USGS Flood Information<\/a>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24358","uid":"31","filename":"BridgestoneArenaFrontPage.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/BridgestoneArenaFrontPage.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"96649","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"42aa81ea-be5a-4612-83f9-5814783170ff","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["FEMA","flood","landsat","NASA","Remote Sensing","water"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1395410409","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
