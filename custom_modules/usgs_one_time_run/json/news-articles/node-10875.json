Old Faithful has\r\nremained faithful for at least the past 135 years, showering appreciative\r\ntourists every 50 to 90 minutes (most recently an average of 91 minutes).<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/usgs.gov\/images\/logos\/nps.jpg\" alt=\"National Park Service\" width=\"52\" height=\"60\" \/>USGS researcher Shaul\r\nHurwitz and his colleagues from Stanford University and Yellowstone National\r\nPark have discovered that changes of water supply to a geyser's underground\r\nplumbing may have a large influence on eruption intervals; that is, the time\r\nbetween eruptions.&nbsp; For example, geysers\r\nappear to lengthen and shorten their intervals on cycles that mimic annual dry\r\nand wet periods.<\/p>\r\n<p>Multi-year precipitation\r\nrecords also strongly correlate with geyser behavior.&nbsp; Based on these results, the study\r\nproposes that an extended drought should result in longer intervals between\r\neruptions, and perhaps even cessation of activity in some geysers. In contrast,\r\nin years with high precipitation, eruption intervals should be more\r\nfrequent.&nbsp; The new research paper,\r\n\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gsajournals.org\/perlserv\/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1130%2FG24723A.1\" target=\"_blank\">Climate-Induced Variations of Geyser Periodicity in Yellowstone National Park,\r\nUSA<\/a>,\" is published in the June issue of the journal <em>Geology<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-5-30\/old_faithful_hires.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-5-30\/old_faithful.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Old Faithful erupting - click for larger version\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" \/><\/a>Additional information: Geysers\r\nare extremely rare; perhaps less than 1000 exist worldwide, with more than half\r\nof them in Yellowstone National Park.&nbsp; The\r\nfamous Old Faithful Geyser was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Yellowstone expedition\r\nand was the first geyser in the Park to be named.&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/archive\/yell\/oldfaithfulcam.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Old Faithful eruptions<\/a> can be viewed on any\r\ncomputer on Earth via a video camera deployed by the National Park Service.\r\nInstrumental data which records geyser eruption times is available at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geyserstudy.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Geyser Observation and Study Association<\/a> web site.&nbsp; Long-term meteorological trends can be\r\ninferred from seasonal streamflow trends like those in the <a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/wy\/nwis\/uv\/?site_no=06037500&amp;agency_cd=USGS\">Madison River<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>This study is a cooperative effort\r\ninvolving the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Idaho","Montana","Wyoming"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geyser","Yellowstone","geology","water","faithful"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1212120000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169953"},{"tid":"170460"},{"tid":"170467"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
