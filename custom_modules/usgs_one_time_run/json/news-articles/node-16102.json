These sensors, which measure water elevation every 30 seconds, augment an already robust network of coastal and inland streamgages in place to monitor water levels throughout the storm.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_175314\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Figure-21.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-175314\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Figure-21-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"A USGS scientist installs a storm-surge sensor for Hurricane Rita in 2005, the first storm in which these sensors were deployed.\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a> A USGS scientist installs a storm-surge sensor for Hurricane Rita in 2005, the first storm in which these sensors were deployed.[\/caption]\n\nIn addition, eight of the recently deployed sensors are Rapid Deployment Gages, which provide real-time information to help forecast floods and coordinate flood-response activities in affected areas. These real-time gages will complement the many near real-time streamgages already installed along rivers and streams.\n\nAll data collected by these sensors and the existing USGS streamgage network are available on the <a href=\"http:\/\/54.243.149.253\/home\/webmap\/viewer.html?webmap=c07fae08c20c4117bdb8e92e3239837e\">USGS Storm-Tide Mapper<\/a>.\n\nWorking with various partner agencies such as NOAA, FEMA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the USGS strapped the storm-surge sensors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 typically about 1 \u00c2\u00bd inches wide and a foot long \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to piers, docks or other structures in the water expected to withstand the storm.\n\nThey record the precise time the storm-tide arrived, how ocean and inland water levels changed during the storm, the depth of the storm-tide throughout the event, and how long it took for the water to recede.\n\nThis information gathered will be used to assess storm damage, discern between wind and flood damage, and improve computer models used to forecast future coastal change.\n\n<strong>Anticipated Coastal Change<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"259\"]<img class=\"    \" src=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/sandy\/coastal-change\/images\/Sandy_vulnerability_Delmarva102912lg.jpg\" alt=\"Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the Atlantic coast of Delmarva.\" width=\"259\" height=\"165\" \/> Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the Atlantic coast of Delmarva.[\/caption]\n\nElevated water levels and waves during tropical storms can lead to dramatic coastal change of beaches and dunes. The USGS has completed an\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/sandy\/coastal-change\/\">assessment of likely coastal-change impacts<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0from Hurricane Sandy.\n\nNearly 91 percent of the coast along the Delmarva Peninsula is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion from the storm, while overwash is expected to affected more than \u00c2\u00a0half of the shoreline, and 22 percent of the beaches are expected to experience inundation by waves and storm surge \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0In these areas, waves and storm surge transport large amounts of sand across coastal environments, depositing sand both inland and offshore, causing significant changes to the landscape.\n\nOverwash, the landward movement of large volumes of sand from overtopped dunes, is forecasted for portions of the east coast with the projected landfall of the storm. The severity of overwash depends on the strength of the storm, the height of the dunes, and how direct a hit the coast takes.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"259\"]<img class=\"    \" src=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/sandy\/coastal-change\/images\/Sandy_vulnerability_NewJersey102912-lg.jpg\" alt=\"Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the Atlantic coast of New Jersey\" width=\"259\" height=\"165\" \/> Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the Atlantic coast of New Jersey[\/caption]\n\nThe models show that along the New Jersey shore, 98 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion, while 54 percent is very likely to experience overwash, and 9 percent to experience inundation.\n\nIt also indicates that on the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., including Fire Island National Seashore, 93 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion, 12 percent to experience overwash, and 4 percent to experience inundation; the lower percentages of overwash and inundation in these areas is because of the relatively high dune elevations.\n\nThe impact of previous storms on sandy beaches along the mid-Atlantic Coast has made them increasingly vulnerable to significant impacts such as erosion.\n\nBeaches and dunes often serve as the first line of defense for coastal communities against flooding and other hazards associated with extreme storms.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"259\"]<img class=\"    \" src=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/sandy\/coastal-change\/images\/Sandy_vulnerability_FireIsland102912lg.jpg\" alt=\"Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the southern coast of Long Island\" width=\"259\" height=\"165\" \/> Probabilities of collision, overwash, and inundation for Sandy for the southern coast of Long Island[\/caption]\n\nAny compromise to these features means that storm-related hazards are more likely to threaten coastal property, infrastructure, and public safety during a future extreme storm event.\n\n<\/div>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24252","uid":"31","filename":"Figure-1-cover.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Figure-1-cover.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"58004","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"33894292-d583-47eb-bbbc-e392e7ff027f","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["coastal","hazards","Hurricane","Hurricane Sandy"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1351548023","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
