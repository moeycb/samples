Computer processing of the recordings will produce a picture of the Earth that is similar to sonograms used in medical imaging. The images of the Earth, however, will extend to nearly a mile depth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>During the field work, expected to last 3 days, the public will see a crew of 7 people working along the side of E. Baldwin and W. Shannon Avenues, accompanied by a large heavy trailer with two white water tanks on the back towed behind a pickup truck, and 2 additional support trucks. The trailer creates vibrations that penetrate below the ground surface, and the reflected echoes of the vibrations are recorded by a long string of sensors stretching out about a half mile from the trailer. The harmless vibrations are not strong enough to be felt except by those standing near the trailer, and will not cause any damage to the roadbed or other structures. The trailer will produce vibrations for about 20-30 seconds in one location, and then move about 15 feet down the road to repeat the process. The survey will cover approximately one half mile per day, moving east to west along the side of the road.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" id=\"gallery_news\" name=\"NR2012_06_21\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photo_shares\/thumbs\/tags\/NR2012_06_21\/1\" title=\"Image Gallery\"><\/iframe><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["earthquake","hazard","Seismic Reflection","Seismic Survey","Spokane","Natural Hazards Earthquake Hazards","Geographic Areas Southwest","Geographic Areas Northwest"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1340251200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168931"},{"tid":"168932"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
