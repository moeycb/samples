The asteroid hits and bam! the next thing we see is the skeleton of the Triceratops lying on the seared landscape, while the surviving small mammals, such as mice and moles, forage in the debris, in their successful quest for survival. <\/p>\r\n<p>Following the animation, patterns for paper models of the Triceratops and a Pterosaur (flying dinosaur) come on the screen, ready to be printed out, colored and glued together. The finished Triceratops measures about eight inches, from horny head to tail, and stands about five inches high. The Pterosaur is about six inches long, from beak to tail, and has a wing span of about five inches. <\/p>\r\n<p>The accompanying 14-page teacher&rsquo;s guide explains the impact of the Chicxulub impact; how scientists determined that such an event had occurred; and where it occurred. A glossary defines the terms used in the report, and an abbreviated geologic time scale defines the various eras when the dinosaurs and their relatives roamed the earth. Descriptions of the Ceratopsians, or \"horned-faced dinosaurs\" and Pterosauria, \"flying reptiles,\" accompany the model patterns of the animals. <\/p>\r\n<p>The HyperCard diskette version of the report is available from the USGS -Information Services, Open-file Report Section, Box 25286, MS 517, Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225, or by calling 1-800-435-7627 or 303-202-4200. The cost is $10 each. A paper version is available at the same address, at a cost of $5.50 plus a handling charge of $3.50. When ordering, be sure to specify: OF 97-442-A, for the diskette, or OF97-442-B, for the paper version. It also can be obtained from the Survey&rsquo;s Learning Web site.

The product also will be demonstrated and will be for sale at the USGS booth in the convention&rsquo;s exhibit hall, Oct. 20-23.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Utah","California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"876974400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
