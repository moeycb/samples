Some changes, like major floods or volcanic eruptions, come quickly; others, like urban sprawl or regrowth from forest fires, appear gradually. Landsat impartially records these and many other changes to the land that are induced by people or nature.\n\nBeyond the scientific information they confer, some Landsat images are simply striking to look at \u00e2\u0080\u0094 presenting spectacular views of mountains, valleys, and islands; forests, grasslands, and agricultural patterns. By selecting certain features and coloring them from a digital palate, the USGS has created a series of \"Earth as Art\" perspectives that demonstrate an artistic resonance in land imagery and provide a special avenue of insight about the geography of each scene.\n\nNASA is preparing to launch the next Landsat satellite in 2013, which will be turned over to USGS for operations and data distribution.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174370\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The Lena River, some 2,800 miles (4,500km) long, is one of the largest rivers in the world.
