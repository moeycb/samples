Some of this response took place days after the hurricanes; other responses included fieldwork and analysis through the spring of 2006. \n<p>\r\n<strong>What:<\/strong> More than half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coast and many of these areas, especially along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, will be in the direct path of future hurricanes. Recent hurricane seasons have been the costliest on record, with losses of \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n$42 billion in 2004 and in the hundreds of billions in 2005. USGS will host Congressional briefings on how science can help the public prepare for hurricane hazards and reduce losses from future hurricanes. Speakers will showcase examples from the report, &quot;Science and the Storms: The USGS Response to the Hurricanes of 2005.&quot; <strong><br \/>\r\n<\/strong>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>When &amp; Where:<\/strong> \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00 a.m. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, Feb. 1, 2008 \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>1116 Longworth House Office Building \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>2:00 p.m. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, Feb. 1, 2008 \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/strong>366 Dirksen Senate Office Building \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Who:<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles R.
