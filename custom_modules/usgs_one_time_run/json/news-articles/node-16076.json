These networks provide real-time data important to the National Weather Service, FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other USGS partners involved in issuing flood and evacuation warnings, coordinating emergency responses to communities, and operating flood-control reservoirs.\n\nData from the USGS Streamgaging Network are routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, determination of flood risk, and for many recreational activities. However, during a storm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s landfall, this network helps capture the depth and duration of storm-surge, as well as the forecasted time of its arrival and retreat. \u00c2\u00a0Understanding storm surge allows for more accurate modeling and prediction capabilities and for improved structure designs and response for public safety. Inland streamgages also are used to track the rainfall and flooding caused by the remnants of the storm.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174802\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"208\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-3.44.13-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-174802  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-3.44.13-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"311\" \/><\/a> Storm tide sensor bracket mounted on a fishing pier at the Fairhope Municipal Pier and Park in Fairhope, AL.[\/caption]\n\nUSGS crews are on alert.\u00c2\u00a0 Immediately after the worst of the storm has passed, USGS hydrologists will deploy to measure high-water marks at rivers and streams and to verify high river flows and peak stages. The crews will also calibrate and repair streamgages damaged by the storm to ensure they continued to transmit information in real time to users working to protect lives and property.\n\nInformation on streamflow and water levels may be especially important in Florida, where the water levels of many rivers are still high from Tropical Storm Debby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy rainfall in June.\n\n<strong>USGS Deploys Additional Storm Surge Sensors on Northern Gulf Coast<\/strong>\n\nStorm surges are increases in ocean water levels generated at sea by extreme storms and can have devastating coastal impacts.\u00c2\u00a0 Prior to extreme weather events, the USGS may also deploy storm surge sensors at key coastal locations just a few days \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or sometimes hours -- before a Hurricane or Tropical Storm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anticipated landfall. These storm surge sensors, housed in vented steel pipes a few inches wide and about a foot long, are installed on bridges, piers and other structures that have a good chance of surviving a storm surge during a hurricane. The number of sensors installed and their locations depend on the strength of the storm as well as what gages may already be in place.\n\nIn preparation for Tropical Storm Isaac, the USGS is already installing a small number of additional sensors in the northern Gulf coast area. \u00c2\u00a0If the storm reaches these sensors, they will record water level and barometric pressure every 30 seconds to document storm-surge crests \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or waves of water \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as they make landfall. \u00c2\u00a0Data will be uploaded to the <a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/hsss\/index.php?\">USGS Hurricane Storm Tide Sensor Map<\/a> if significant storm-tide is recorded. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Following the storm, USGS crews will retrieve these sensors and begin to analyze the data.\n\nTogether, the USGS Streamgaging Network and the mobile USGS storm surge sensors provide critical data to the National Weather Service, FEMA and other USGS partners involved in issuing flood and evacuation warnings and in coordinating emergency responses to communities. In the event of a large tropical storm event, storm surge information will also help public officials assess storm damage, discern between wind and flood damage, and improve computer models used to forecast future floods.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174798\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"305\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-1.44.49-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-174798  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-1.44.49-PM.png\" alt=\"See caption:\" width=\"305\" height=\"142\" \/><\/a> Screenshot of interactive map which illustrates areas vulnerable to erosion during a Category 1 hurricane landfall.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Monitoring Coastal Change<\/strong>\n\nSand overwash, which occurs when waves and storm surge overtop dunes and transport sand landward, is a likely impact of hurricanes and tropical storms. The severity of erosion and overwash depends on the strength of the storm, beach elevation, and how direct a hit the coast takes.\n\nWhile it's difficult to tell where exactly the storm is headed or what its impacts may be, USGS scientists are using state-of-the art models to give emergency managers and local residents an accurate picture of what coastal changes are likely to occur if the tropical storm makes landfall along the Gulf Coast of the United States.\n\nA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article_pf.asp?ID=3224\">new USGS report<\/a> determines the probabilities of dune erosion, overwash and inundation during direct hurricane landfall for sandy beaches along the entire\u00c2\u00a0U.S. Gulf Coast shoreline. This report includes a publicly available<a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/erosionhazards\/gom\/map.html\">\u00c2\u00a0interactive map<\/a> which anyone can use to focus on different parts of Gulf Coast shoreline and view how the likelihood of erosion changes depending on hurricane intensity.\n\nThis model shows that during the landfall of a Category1 storm, where winds are between 75 and 94 miles per hour, overwash is very likely for 70 percent of Gulf Coast beaches. Overwash is likely at these locations because of increased water levels at the shoreline. During Category1 hurricane events on the Gulf Coast, wave height and storm surge combine to increase water levels at the shoreline by 14 and a half feet higher than their normal levels.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174797\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"299\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-1.43.30-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-174797 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-24-at-1.43.30-PM.png\" alt=\"An aerial image of a hotel in Orange Beach, Alabama, which was toppled during Hurricane Ivan in 2004.\" width=\"299\" height=\"206\" \/><\/a> A hotel in Orange Beach, Alabama, was toppled during Hurricane Ivan in 2004.
