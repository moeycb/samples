The current river system also is highlighted through a compilation of aerial photographs, USGS data, and USGS publications.<\/p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson won approval from Congress to create the Corps of Discovery. This small expeditionary group was charged to explore the uncharted West and was led by Jefferson&rsquo;s secretary, Meriwether Lewis, and Lewis&rsquo; friend, William Clark. The Corps of Discovery traveled thousands of miles from 1803 to 1807, encountering territory and peoples that no Americans ever had before.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"As we approach the bicentennial of Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s famous expedition, we thought the public would be interested in learning about the explorers&rsquo; trek through North Dakota and how the USGS continues to investigate many of the natural features observed by Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery,\" said Doug Emerson, USGS scientist in North Dakota. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["North Dakota"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1007355600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169280"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
