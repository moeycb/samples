The new vessel features several new nautical advances, including a high-performance hull, constructed entirely from aluminum, allowing for lighter weight and increased speed and stability. The vessel was designed with state-of-the-art navigation and scientific capabilities, giving the USGS modern scientific resources for research into Lake Ontario&rsquo;s coastal and deep-water ecosystems.<\/p>\r\n<p>Vessel construction was funded by an $8.2 million award from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The USGS contracted with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thegreatlakesgroup.com\/\">Great Lakes Towing Company<\/a> of Cleveland, Ohio, in 2010 for the design and construction of the new research vessels. The new boats were completed in July 2012.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Geographic Areas Midwest","water","Water National Water Quality Assessment","Water Hydrologic Researchand Development","Water Hydrologic Networksand Analysis","Water Cooperative Water","Ecosystems Fisheries Aquaticand Endangered Resources","Ecosystems Terrestrial Freshwaterand Marine Environments","ecosystems"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Biology"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1407124800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169773"},{"tid":"170026"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
