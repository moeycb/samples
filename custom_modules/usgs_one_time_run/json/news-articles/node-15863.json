We contributed to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, including new <a href=\"http:\/\/cida.usgs.gov\/glri\/projects\/invasive_species\/control_Asian_carp.html\">treatment tools to help control Asian carp<\/a>, an invasive species, and launch of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_science_pick\/meet-the-fleet-twin-sisters-join-great-lakes-fleet\/\">new research vessels being deployed<\/a> to understand the deep-water ecosystems and fishes of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. USGS water quality monitoring and analysis, and water availability monitoring is taking place in waterways across the Nation at seven pilot locations that are part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/news\/pressreleases\/Federal-Agencies-Partner-to-Revitalize-Urban-Waterways-In-Communities-Across-the-US.cfm\">Urban Waters Federal Partnership<\/a>: the Anacostia, Patapsco, Harlem, Bronx, and Los Angeles watersheds; the South Platte River, and the Lake Pontchartrain area. In the Grand Canyon, USGS science on uranium resources, hydrology, and the past impacts of mining informed <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/news\/pressreleases\/Secretary-Salazar-Announces-Decision-to-Withdraw-Public-Lands-near-Grand-Canyon-from-New-Mining-Claims.cfm\">the decision to withdraw Federal lands around the Grand Canyon from new mining claims<\/a>. USGS science also played a significant role in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/restoration\/index.cfm\">Department of the Interior Natural Resource Damage Assessment<\/a>settlements including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the Tyrone Mine area in New Mexico.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Wind turbines at certain sites in North America each cause dozens of bat fatalities per year.\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/10_19_2009\/s84Aq11PPk_10_19_2009\/medium\/02_Bats_and_Wind_Energy.JPG\" alt=\"Wind Turbines against a blue sky\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/>[\/caption]\n\nOn the <strong>new energy frontier<\/strong> the USGS continues to lead the way in the Department of the Interior with the release of <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2011\/5036\/\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cWind Energy in the United States and Materials Required for the Land Based Wind Turbine Industry from 2010 Through 2030.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<\/a> The data suggest that, with the exception of rare earth elements, there should not be a shortage of the principal materials required for electricity generation from wind energy. In the area of wind and wildlife, our scientists are using near-infrared videography to monitor and research bat activity at wind turbines, as a side effect of the expansion of wind energy is increased bird and bat mortality at turbines. We also continue to focus on conventional sources of energy development, evidenced in our summary report of the science needs for <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1370\/\">conventional energy development for the Chukchi and Beaufort seas<\/a>. In the area of unconventional gas, the USGS worked with the Department of Energy and provided information for their report on the needed reforms for unconventional gas production, and the USGS is working with the Environmental Protection Agency and DOE on a strategy to fill those research gaps. <em><\/em>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"A submarine berg emerges from the advancing terminus of Yahtse Glacier.

We also completed a study measuring the amount of <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/pp\/1787\/\">stored carbon in the ecosystems of the Great Plains<\/a>. This study was the first regional report that applied a comprehensive methodology designed by the USGS in 2010.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Scientists hike up the Little Colorado River to assist in installing remote PIT tag readers to more efficiently keep track of native, endangered fish populations.\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/07_01_2011\/k52Ri77HHc_07_01_2011\/medium\/LittleColorado.JPG\" alt=\"Scientists hike up the Little Colorado River to assist in installing remote PIT tag readers.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Water<\/strong> continues to be a contentious issue in various parts of the country. In 2011, the USGS launched a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/news\/pressreleases\/Partnerships-in-the-Colorado-River-Basin-Demonstrate-National-Promise-of-Interiors-WaterSMART-Program.cfm\">geographic focus study on the Colorado River basin<\/a>, part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usbr.gov\/WaterSMART\/\">WaterSMART<\/a> availability and land use assessment, a three-year study that will provide an inventory of water supply and demand. The effort includes assessing water needed to support ecosystems and will report significant competition over water resources and the factors causing the competition. Water information can also be sent to your email inbox or your phone, thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/wateralert\/\">WaterAlert<\/a>. This tool allows users to be notified daily of water levels at any of our 7,600 real-time streamgages across the country. Addressing the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water resource challenges is a priority for the USGS, and in 2011 we <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2797\">formed an innovative partnership to do just that<\/a> with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This partnership will provide a one-stop portal to integrated water information for stakeholders with forecasts showing where water for drinking, industry, and ecosystems will be available.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"195\" caption=\"Josh Latimore stands in front of Burney Falls.

Landsat has often helped provide a big-picture perspective on natural hazards both domestic and foreign and ranging from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2821\">tornados<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/topics\/earth\/features\/japanquake\/landsat20110317_prt.htm\">tsunamis<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2822\">wildfires<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.usgs.gov\/index.php\">Landsat<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0is a joint effort of both\u00c2\u00a0USGS\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0NASA. In addition to imagery of natural hazard events, Landsat provides valuable data for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/climate_landuse\/\">land use research<\/a> and advances the Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important role in <a href=\"http:\/\/remotesensing.usgs.gov\/index.php\">land remote sensing<\/a> under the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/fact-sheet-national-space-policy\">President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Space Policy<\/a>. Landsat images provide complete global coverage, they are available for free, and they span nearly 40 years of continuous earth observation. No other satellite imagery has that combination of attributes. To date, over 6 million scenes have been downloaded; over 2.6 million were downloaded in 2011.\n\nThese highlights are but a few of the USGS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant accomplishments and activities in 2011.
