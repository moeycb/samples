For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059687\">previous studies have found<\/a> that insect pests &ndash; such as scale insects &ndash; thrive in urban environments.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;Unless we change course, over the next 50 years urbanization will have a more pronounced ecological impact in many non-coastal areas of the Southeast than climate change, said Jennifer Costanza, a research associate at NC State and a co-author of the study. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to predict precisely what the specific ecological outcomes would be, but so far, the projections are not good in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem health.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">This research emphasizes how decision makers involved in community planning will need a well-thought out strategy for future development, Costanza said.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;Given that urbanization poses significant challenges to this region, decision makers will need to begin serious, long-term discussions about economic development, ecological impacts and the value of non-urban spaces,&rdquo; she added.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The paper, &ldquo;The southern megalopolis: using the past to predict the future of urban sprawl in the Southeast U.S.,&rdquo; is published in <em>PLOS ONE<\/em>.
