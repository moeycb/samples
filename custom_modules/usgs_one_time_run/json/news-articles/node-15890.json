The excitement of seeing leaves change colors during the fall, as well as the flight of migratory birds, are visual signs of season changes that people look forward to every year. These visual cues have a name: phenology. Phenology is the study of the influence of climate on the timing of biological events and a science that occurs right in front of our eyes. We do not need microscopes or fancy labs, but each of us can have fun with phenology on our own and at the same time, help scientists understand the effects of climate on things like when birds migrate, trees bloom, or insects emerge.
