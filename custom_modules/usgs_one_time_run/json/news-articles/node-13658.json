WNS continues to spread across North America and has caused drastic declines in hibernating bat populations.<\/p>\r\n<p>This research will be conducted by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center<\/a> (NWHC) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecohealthalliance.org\/\">EcoHealth Alliance<\/a>, a nonprofit organization that focuses on local conservation and global health issues. It is being funded by a grant from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/WhiteNoseSyndrome\/\">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Bats are an important part of the North American ecosystem, providing for example billions of dollars in pest control to our agricultural industry every year,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"The USGS and its partners are racing against the clock to understand and find clues that will help us combat this new disease and save this valuable resource.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists will investigate environmental conditions within bat hibernacula (caves and mines used by hibernating bats) to identify potential factors that contribute to disease development and severity. <em>&nbsp;<\/em>Scientists will assess how environmental factors affect the growth and persistence of the deadly fungus in the environment and on bats within hibernation sites. Research will target six hibernacula in the East and Midwest U.S. Each site will be monitored for microclimate conditions and quantity of the deadly fungus on bats, soil, and rock surfaces throughout the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Geomyces destructans<\/em> can persist within the environment of bat hibernacula, potentially causing bats to become infected during hibernation. This suggests that environmental factors play an important role in the spread and severity of WNS.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Our knowledge of climatic variation and distribution of the fungus within bat hibernacula is currently very limited\" said Dr. Michelle Verant, a University of Wisconsin veterinary epidemiologist working at the NWHC and collaborating on the study.&nbsp; \"A better understanding of how these factors are related to the manifestation of WNS in affected sites will be vital for managing this disease.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The team of scientists will also develop and test predictive models to forecast the progression of WNS across the U.S. and Canada. To date, WNS had been found in 19 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USFWS recently announced seven grant awards totaling $1.4 million for research and management of WNS in bats, thus providing critical support for investigating WNS. In addition to the environmental conditions study, the USGS was also awarded a grant to investigate the potential for bats to transmit <em>Geomyces destructans<\/em> during the summer when they use hibernacula contaminated with the fungus.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS NWHC continues to be on the forefront of research into WNS. Studies conducted at the NWHC led to the discovery, characterization, and naming of the causative agent, the fungus <em>Geomyces destructans<\/em>, and to the development of standardized diagnostic criteria for characterizing the disease. Additionally, the Center has pioneered techniques for studying impacts of the fungus to hibernating bats.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS NWHC, based in Madison, Wisc., provides leadership to safeguard wildlife and ecosystem health through dynamic partnerships and exceptional science.
