This is still true today as adjoining farms may share climate, slope and viticulture, yet produce crops that are vastly different.

The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic; speakers are encouraged to thoroughly explain the subject matter and to define any words or terms that may be unfamiliar. The USGS lecture series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Feature-Image.jpg\"><\/a>Mounds of grape seeds in prehistoric caves testify that early people had more than a passing acquaintance with wine.
