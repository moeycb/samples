Viewing an erupting volcano in Hawaii is a memorable experience, and one that attracts the attention of many people around the globe, scientists and non-scientists alike.&nbsp; Because Hawaiian eruptions are generally non-explosive, they can be observed and studied with relative safety, allowing scientists to better understand eruptive processes and products and providing tourists unforgettable memories.&nbsp; Over geologic time, volcanic activity, in Hawaii and elsewhere in the world, has created and shaped more than 80 percent of the Earth&rsquo;s surface, above and below the sea.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hawaiian shield volcanoes are known for their relatively non-explosive eruptive style compared with the typically explosive activity of composite volcanoes like Mount St. Helens Volcano. The latest edition of &ldquo;Eruptions of Hawaiian Volcanoes&mdash;Past, Present, and Future&rdquo; offers further details on the different types of volcanoes and provides the most up-to-date information about the hazards associated with Hawaiian volcanism.<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS General Information Product #117, &ldquo;Eruptions of Hawaiian volcanoes; past, present, and future,&rdquo; by Robert Tilling, Christina Heliker, and Donald Swanson, is available as a free pdf online: <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/117\/\">http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/gip\/117\/<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>A limited number of free printed booklets are also available (for a $5.00 handling fee) from: <a href=\"http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/<\/a> or by writing to USGS Information Services, Box 25286, &#8232;Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225&#8232;telephone: 888 ASK-USGS; e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:infoservices@usgs.gov\">infoservices@usgs.gov<\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Hawaii","volcano","book","K\u012blauea","Mauna Loa","hazard","geology",""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1307419200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
