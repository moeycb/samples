It illustrates the wide scope of application, examines some new techniques for acquiring data from repeat photography, and demonstrates that this remains a valuable and cost-effective means for monitoring future changes, particularly in developing countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>A product of the USGS&rsquo; project on landscape change in the southwestern United States, based in Tucson, the book was edited Robert H.
