Changes in dust trajectories and amount of deposition over the last glacial-to-interglacial period has varied, and records of these changes are found in ice sheets, lakes, ocean basins, and soils,&nbsp;which have captured dust sediments over space and time. Studying&nbsp;these records allows USGS scientists to better understand how dust&nbsp;has affected Earth processes, such as climate and vegetation growth.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Airborne Matter \"Geotoxicology:\" Public Health, Policy, and Environmental Security<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Geoffrey S.
