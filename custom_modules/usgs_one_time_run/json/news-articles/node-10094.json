The hurricane made landfall in Humacao and exited through Hormigueros, tearing a path along the central part of Puerto Rico*. Not since hurricanes San Felipe in 1928 and San Ciprian in 1932, had the island been bisected lengthwise by the path of a hurricane. \n<p>\r\n<p>Hurricane Georges produced heavy rains over Puerto Rico, especially in the interior of the island. The U.S. Geological Survey raingage network* reported 24-hour rainfall totals that ranged from less than 5 inches in most of northern Puerto Rico to about 25 inches at Jayuya near the island&rsquo;s geographic center. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Hurricane Georges caused tremendous damage to the infrastructure of Puerto Rico. According to Government officials, 99.5 percent of the population was left without electricity, 77.2 percent without water, and 24 percent without telephone service. Many municipalities in the central part of Puerto Rico were isolated from the rest of the island because of bridges that were swept away and broken trees blocking the roads. Numerous landslides have been reported throughout the island. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS continues to play an important role in providing scientific information before, during, and after the passage of hurricanes. The USGS maintains a network of 123 near real-time gaging stations in Puerto Rico for measuring river stage (height) and discharge (volume), lake elevations, and precipitation. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>This network transmits data via satellite to a receiving station in the USGS Caribbean District office in Guaynabo. During normal operations these stations transmit every 4 hours and the data is available to the general public on the Internet (<a href=\"http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov<\/a>). This information is used to forecast water availability for drinking water supply and for agricultural and industrial uses. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>During storm events, the stations go into an alert mode and transmit on a special channel every 5 minutes. The information received is vital for emergency decisions by the Government of Puerto Rico. As soon as the stations detect a rapid rise in the stage of the river, government officials can use the information for emergency management purposes. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>At Lake Carra\u00c3\u00adzo (Lago Lo\u00c3\u00adza), an entire network has been designed to collect precipitation data that is fed into a hydraulic streamflow routing model to generate hydrographs at different stations upstream of the reservoir so that the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) will be able to predict how much water will enter the reservoir and thus determine the release that must be made from the dam. This is very important because lake Carra\u00c3\u00adzo is the major public water supply source for the San Juan metropolitan area. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS has developed a robust system through the use of a cooperative agreement with the Civil Defense. The system consists of emergency power generators, a digital receiving ground station (DRGS), a dependable backup system at the USGS National Headquarters in Reston, Virginia, and a highly trained and dependable workforce. Before Hurricane Georges approached Puerto Rico, all USGS stations were checked to ensure that they were completely operational and ready for the storm. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>During the hurricane, Computer Specialist, Dianne L\u00c3\u00b3pez-Trujillo, remained in the Caribbean District office to monitor the computer system and respond to any request from the emergency unit at PRASA and Civil Defense. Civil Engineer, Mario L. Oliveras, was stationed at the Civil Defense Headquarters with a portable computer with access to the USGS mainframe computer. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>When the full impact of the hurricane hit San Juan, the sat","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Puerto Rico"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"907128000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170289"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
