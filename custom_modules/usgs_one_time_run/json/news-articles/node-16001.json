Two contributing factors are low vegetation cover and disturbance to soil surfaces.\n\nVegetation contributes to ecological integrity. The presence of plants reduces soil erosion and dust storms, because it keeps the soil intact, reduces wind momentum, and traps moving soil particles (See Figure 1). In spaces between the plants, many undisturbed desert soils are naturally armored by hardened physical and biological crusts.\n\nLow vegetation cover can especially be a problem in drought years in abandoned agricultural fields, which are generally dominated by annual plants. This means that the consequences of dust storms, including motor vehicle crashes, are high in a drought year and low in years with more precipitation (See Figure 2).\n\nSimilarly, in places where land-use activities destroy or reduce soil crusts and weaken soil stability, experts know to assume higher dust storm activity than in places where soils are left undisturbed.\n\nFuture climate scenarios predict that drought conditions will worsen, and therefore more dust storms are likely.\n\nNevertheless, site restoration and reduced disturbance can mitigate some of the factors that promote dust emission.The USGS and land managers are working together to better understand the causes and sources of dust storm activity in the southwestern United States.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_172551\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"478\" caption=\"Figure 1: The presence of plants reduces soil erosion and dust storms because it keeps the soil intact, reduces wind momentum, and traps moving soil particles.
