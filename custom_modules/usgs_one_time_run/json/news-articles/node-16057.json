Our mission is to provide leaders, land and resource managers, and the public with the tools necessary to meet these challenges.\n\nNow we need your help to ensure that our science is headed in the right direction. Based partly on feedback we received from the public last year, we have created draft strategies for each of our major areas of research.\n\nTo read and comment on the drafts, visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/start_with_science\/\">Start with Science site<\/a>.
