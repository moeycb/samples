During the last few days, steamflow at most gaging stations in the Souris River Basin are the largest recorded in about 40 years since the floods of 1969, 1976, and 1979.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since early April, four USGS hydrographers have been servicing the 17 streamgages in the Souris River Basin and measuring streamflow and water levels at all stations,&rdquo; said Gregg Wiche, director of the USGS North Dakota Water Science Center. &ldquo;The USGS data are used by various National, State, and local agencies for flood forecasts, the operation of dams and levees, and decision making.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS collects data from more than 100 streamgages in North Dakota, most of which provide real-time data that is transmitted every hour.
