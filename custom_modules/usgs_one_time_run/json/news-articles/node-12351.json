Field observations and radiocarbon dating suggest that the sand blows formed as the result of two to four earthquakes between 4,800 and 10,000 years ago.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>As part of the Eastern Section of the Seismological Society of America meeting in Little Rock, Oct. 17-18, scientists from around the world will examine this evidence of the prehistoric earthquakes exposed in a trench that was excavated across one of the prominent sand blows<\/strong>. Geological techniques used to map sand blows, feeder dikes, and related ground failure to characterize faulting will also be shared.<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>When: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><strong>Sunday, Oct. 16, 12 p.m. <\/strong><br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><strong>Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and other earthquake experts from around the world. <\/strong><br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Where:&nbsp; <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td><strong>Lee Road 232, Marianna, Ark., GPS coordinates <\/strong>34.705229,-90.801787: a site of large and weathered sand blows that formed between 4.8 and 10 thousand years ago in the Marianna area. <strong>The site is approximately 1.5 hours from <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/9mxbp\"><strong>Memphis<\/strong><\/a><strong> and 2 from <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/4z55u\"><strong>Little Rock<\/strong><\/a><strong>.&nbsp;Please contact Heidi Koontz at <\/strong><a href=\"mailto:hkoontz@usgs.gov\"><strong>hkoontz@usgs.gov<\/strong><\/a><strong> for exact directions.<\/strong><br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Why: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;Major earthquakes have occurred in the New Madrid area for centuries.
