More than 30 countries now have Earth observing satellites, reflecting a wide range of national priorities around the world for environmental monitoring and economic growth. In the United States, the federal government invests about $3.5 billion annually in civil Earth observations and data across multiple agencies, while leveraging related investments that are also made by state, local and tribal governments, academia, and industry. The U.S. government is the largest provider of environmental and Earth-system data in the world. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/landsat-8-celebrates-first-year-of-success\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a>, a bureau of the Department of the Interior, is a major contributor to this mission. The information derived from Earth observations supplies the foundation for scientific advances in many fields and enables numerous federal agencies and partners to carry out their missions. Federal investments in various aspects of Earth observation are conservatively estimated to <a href=\"http:\/\/csis.org\/files\/media\/csis\/pubs\/080725_wigbels_earthobservation_web.pdf\">add $30 billion<\/a> to the U.S. economy each year by providing Americans with critical knowledge about natural resources, climate and weather, disaster events, land-use change, ecosystem health, ocean trends, and many other phenomena.

As the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Earth observation capacity has grown, so has the complexity and challenge of assuring its most effective use. In 2010, Congress charged the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) with establishing a mechanism to ensure greater coordination among the 11 departments and agencies of the federal government that are funded to conduct Earth observation programs. In response, OSTP recently released a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/microsites\/ostp\/NSTC\/2014_earthobs_factsheet.pdf\">National Plan for Civil Earth Observations<\/a> that aims to maximize the value of Earth observation data collected by federal agencies. The Plan is a blueprint for future federal investments and strategic partnerships in Earth observing systems. It lays out federal priorities and supporting actions to manage Earth observation systems through periodic assessments, interagency planning, and international collaboration. <strong>USGS in the National Plan<\/strong> The plan includes a list of 145 high-impact Earth observation systems. The top 15 systems form a select top tier and are ranked in order of importance, according to carefully identified priorities. USGS systems make up three of the top 15. First on the prioritized list is the Global Position System (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gps.gov\/\">GPS<\/a>). In second place is the national weather radar network, Next Generation Weather Radar (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.roc.noaa.gov\/WSR88D\/\">NEXRAD<\/a>).
