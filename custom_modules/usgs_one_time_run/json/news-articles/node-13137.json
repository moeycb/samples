Modeled on the traditional, instantly recognized, paper-based 7.5-minute topographic series, these new maps use the best available government digital data.<\/p>\r\n<p>A further efficiency gain is that rather than having USGS personnel print, distribute, and store paper copies, the entire US Topo collection is available as digital files and is distributed free of charge, through the Web, via the <a href=\"http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/b2c_usgs\/usgs\/maplocator\/%28ctype=areaDetails&amp;xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&amp;carea=%24ROOT&amp;layout=6_1_61_48&amp;uiarea=2%29\/.do\">USGS Store<\/a>. Digital US Topo map files are designed to be easily printed on demand.<\/p>\r\n<p>Improved production processes instituted by the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (<a href=\"http:\/\/ngtoc.usgs.gov\/\">NGTOC<\/a>) will allow the entire contiguous U.S. to be remapped every three years. The USGS is <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/about.html\">on track<\/a> to meet this ambitious goal.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2009, a developmental product was introduced, a planimetric (no relief) map, called Digital Map &ndash; Beta. At the start of 2010, the USGS began adding elevation contours and hydrography (lakes, rivers and streams) and rebranded the map series as US Topo. Currently available US Topo and earlier Digital Map &ndash; Beta files are available <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/\">online<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geography","Mapping","Topo","topographic Map","digital Map","National Map","National Geospatial Program","store","National Geospatial Technical Operations Center","Hydrography","contours","Digital Map Beta"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1284609600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170136"},{"tid":"170047"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
