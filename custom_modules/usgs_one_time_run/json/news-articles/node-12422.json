On Jan. 21, the observatory will open for public tours, exhibits and demonstrations.&nbsp; The National Park Service has granted free admission to Hawai&lsquo;i Volcanoes National Park on Saturday in honor of HVO&rsquo;s centennial.<\/p>\r\n<p>Island residents and visitors will be able to learn about the eruptive history and current status of Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s active volcanoes and how HVO scientists monitor them. Among the many activities:<\/p>\r\n<p>See evidence of K&#299;lauea&rsquo;s explosive eruptions in 200- to 300-year-old ash layers exposed near the observatory.&nbsp; An HVO scientist will tell the story of these deposits on the hour from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.<\/p>\r\n<p>Learn how thermal and time-lapse images can &ldquo;see&rdquo; heat and are used to study and document volcanic activity.<\/p>\r\n<p>Look through a microscope at &lsquo;a&lsquo;&#257; and p&#257;hoehoe lava, Pele's hair and tears, and more.<\/p>\r\n<p>Test the acidity of your drinking water. Bring a small, clean plastic container filled with the water you want tested.<\/p>\r\n<p>See a gas chromatograph in action, &ldquo;taste&rdquo; (learn to recognize) volcanic gases and watch a sulfur gas experiment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Learn how and why HVO scientists measure changes in a volcano&rsquo;s shape.<\/p>\r\n<p>See examples of the instruments that are used to monitor Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s volcanoes.<\/p>\r\n<p>See how data from 100+ field stations that record volcanic and earthquake activity 24\/7 are analyzed and made public.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Sketch a Hawaiian volcano or your vision of an eruption.<\/p>\r\n<p>View the winning entries in HVO&rsquo;s poster contest for Hawai&lsquo;i Island fourth-grade students. Awards will be presented to the winners at 10 a.m.<\/p>\r\n<p>Learn how and why earthquakes occur in Hawai&lsquo;i and how to prepare your home for the next &ldquo;big one.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Parking is available at nearby K&#299;lauea Military Camp. A free shuttle will run between the camp and HVO.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since 1912, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has led efforts not only to understand the workings of Hawai&lsquo;i&rsquo;s volcanoes but also to advance volcano science worldwide. K&#299;lauea has erupted 48 times on HVO&rsquo;s watch, with an ongoing summit eruption since 2008. Mauna Loa, the largest volcano on Earth, has erupted 12 times in that period, most recently in 1984, when lava flowed to within 4 miles of Hilo. HVO scientists monitor this seismic and volcanic activity and provide emergency managers with timely and effective warnings to help reduce the risk of volcanic hazards.<\/p>\r\n<p>HVO thanks Hawai&lsquo;i Volcanoes National Park, K&#299;lauea Military Camp, Hawai&lsquo;i Pacific Parks Association, Volcano Art Center, the USGS Ecosystems K&#299;lauea Field Station, and the UH-Hilo Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes for their participation in HVO&rsquo;s centennial event.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information about HVO, the open house, and other Centennial and Volcano Awareness Month events, please visit the HVO website at <a href=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\/\">hvo.wr.usgs.gov<\/a> or call (808) 967-8844.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","Hawaiian Volcano Observatory","volcano"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1326776400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169558"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
