Several of the 1,446 new US Topo quadrangles for the state now display parts of the Trails along with other improved layers.<!--introend--><\/p>\r\n<p>These trails are two of 11 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/nts\/index.htm\">National Scenic Trails<\/a> in the U.S.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Recreationists love maps and the Washington State US Topo maps will provide great planning and navigation tools for hikers and equestrians using the PCT,\" said Beth Boyst, U.S. Forest Service Pacific Crest Trail Program Manager. \"'Plan ahead and prepare' for the trip is the corner stone of 'Leave No Trace' principles of backcountry travel.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail is a treasured pathway through some of the most scenic terrain in the nation. Beginning in southern California at the Mexican border, the PCT travels a total distance of 2,650 miles through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304733\">California<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304735\">Oregon<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304737\">Washington<\/a> until reaching the Canadian border. The PCT is one of the original National Scenic Trails established by Congress in the 1968 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/nts\/legislation.html\">National Trails System Act<\/a> and fifty-four percent of the trail lies within designated wilderness.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The Pacific Northwest Trail travels through rugged, remote wilderness areas and downtown Main Streets in gateway communities,\" says Matt McGrath, the Pacific Northwest Trail Program Manager for the U.S. Forest Service. \"These new maps will improve recreational experiences by better connecting visitors to the varied opportunities available along the PNT.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Northwest Trail begins near the Continental Divide in Glacier National Park and travels more than 1,200 miles through Montana, Idaho, and Washington before reaching its western terminus at the Pacific Ocean near Cape Alava. The Trail was designated by Congress as a NST in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/PLAW-111publ11\/pdf\/PLAW-111publ11.pdf\">Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS partnered with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/\">National Forest Service<\/a> to incorporate the two trails onto the Washington US Topo maps. These two NST's join the Ice Age National Scenic Trail in Wisconsin as being <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3661\">featured on the new Topo maps<\/a>. The USGS hopes to eventually include all National Scenic Trails in <em>The National Map <\/em>products. &shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;<\/p>\r\n<p>These new maps replace the first edition US Topo maps for Washington and are available for free download from <a href=\"http:\/\/nationa","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington","Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Core Science Systems National Geospatial","washington","topographic Map","Topo Maps","digital Map","digital Topographic Map","Digital Topo Maps","Topo","Forest Service Trails","National Scenic Trails","Forest Service","The National Map","Historical Topographic Map Collection"],"distribution":["Mapping"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1392181200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169516"},{"tid":"170049"},{"tid":"170086"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
