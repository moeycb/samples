These pythons, large constricting snakes native to Asia that can reach more than 20 feet in length and upwards of 200 pounds, are now found throughout much of southern Florida, including all of Everglades National Park. Since the recognition 11 years ago that these invasive, exotic snakes were breeding in the park, formerly common mammals there have declined dramatically.\n\nThe status of species that are rare, patchily distributed, active during the day, or that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cross roads was not assessed in this new study.\n\nThe university and federal scientists who conducted the study found that the most severe declines in mammals appear to have occurred in the remote southernmost regions of the park, where pythons have been established the longest. \u00c2\u00a0In this area, observations of raccoons dropped 99.3 percent, opossums 98.9 percent and bobcats 87.5 percent.\u00c2\u00a0 Marsh and cottontail rabbits, as well as foxes, were not seen at all in recent years, despite having been present in the 1990s.\n\nThe authors suggested that one reason for such dramatic declines in such a short time is that these prey species may be \u00e2\u0080\u009cna\u00c3\u00afve\u00e2\u0080\u009d to large constrictor snakes -- that is, they are not used to being preyed upon by pythons since such large snakes have not existed in the eastern United States for millions of years. In addition, some of the declining species could be both victims of being eaten by pythons and of having to compete with pythons for food.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Florida Everglades.

Based on the geographic extent of the Burmese python population in Florida and knowledge of detection rates for other snakes, experts estimate that a population of at least tens of thousands now live in the wild in Florida, but stress that this estimate is extremely rough.\u00c2\u00a0 Population size may have dropped somewhat as a result of the severe cold snap of early 2010, but the population is expected to quickly recover from this unusual event.\n\nBurmese pythons have traits that increased their risk of establishment and that make their eradication difficult. Specifically, Burmese pythons:\n<ul>\n\t<li>grow rapidly to a large size (one over 16-feet long was captured in the Everglades in January 2012);<\/li>\n\t<li>are habitat generalists (they can live in many kinds of habitats);<\/li>\n\t<li>are dietary generalists (can eat a variety of mammals, birds and reptiles);<\/li>\n\t<li>may be arboreal (tree-living) when young, which puts birds and arboreal mammals such as squirrels and bats at risk and provides another avenue for quick dispersal of the snakes;<\/li>\n\t<li>are tolerant of urbanization (can live in urban\/suburban areas);<\/li>\n\t<li>are well-concealed \u00e2\u0080\u009csit-and-wait\u00e2\u0080\u009d predators (difficult to detect and difficult to trap due to their infrequent movements between hiding places);<\/li>\n\t<li>mature rapidly \u00c2\u00a0and produce many offspring (females can store sperm and fertilize their eggs \u00e2\u0080\u0094which can number more than 100 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when conditions are favorable for bearing young);<\/li>\n\t<li>achieve high population densities (resulting in a greater impact on native wildlife); and<\/li>\n\t<li>serve as potential hosts for parasites and diseases of economic and human health significance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nAs a result, Burmese pythons pose considerable challenges for the ecosystems of South Florida and many of the animals that live there, including threated and endangered species. Federal and state agencies or institutions are working hard to deal with the serious threats caused by this invasive species.\u00c2\u00a0 USGS research aims to help managers preserve and restore the Everglades\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ecosystems.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"375\" caption=\"A female Burmese python (Python molurus) on her nest with eggs.

In the case of the Burmese python, the new study shows that pythons appear to have begun to markedly alter the Everglades ecosystem by changing food webs through depleting or eliminating vulnerable native species. If enough animals are lost, entire ecosystem processes could be disrupted.\n\nScientists found little support for alternative explanations for the mammals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 decline, such as disease or changes in habitat. Scientists also ruled out predation by black bears and Florida panthers as the cause, since these populations have not grown in size during the past 15 years. Additionally, researchers ruled out mid-sized predators, such as foxes and bobcats, as the cause of these mammal declines since these two species have also experienced significant declines.\n\n<strong>Can the Everglades be Rid of These Pythons? <\/strong>\n\nThe odds of eradicating an introduced population of reptiles once it has spread across a large area are very low, pointing to the importance of prevention, early detection and rapid response. \u00c2\u00a0And with the Burmese python now distributed across more than a thousand square miles of southern Florida, including all of Everglades National Park and areas to the north such as Big Cypress National Preserve, the chances of eliminating the snake completely from the region is low. However, controlling their numbers and preventing their spread are critical goals for South Florida land managers. For example, a number of Burmese pythons have been found in the Florida Keys, but there is no confirmation yet that a breeding population exists in the Keys.\u00c2\u00a0 Given a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3066&amp;from=rss_home\">USGS study<\/a> that showed the python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent ability to disperse via salt water, island residents and resource managers need to stay vigilant so as to be able to detect and eliminate arriving pythons before they become established.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a rule in the <em>Federal Register<\/em> that will restrict the importation and interstate transportation of four non-native constrictor snakes (Burmese python, northern and southern African pythons, and the yellow anaconda) that threaten the Everglades and other sensitive ecosystems. These snakes are being listed as injurious species under the Lacey Act. In addition, the FWS will continue to consider listing as injurious five other species of nonnative snakes: the reticulated python, boa constrictor, DeSchauensee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anaconda, green anaconda and Beni anaconda.

These costs are borne by farmers, ranchers, businesses, and local, state, tribal and federal governments battling to control the economic, health and environmental threats these invaders pose.\u00c2\u00a0 Invasive species adversely affect every state in the country,\u00c2\u00a0 in both urban centers and wilderness areas. Increased global travel and trade provides pathways for both intentional and unintentional introductions of invasive species. <strong><\/strong>\n\nExperts note that Florida has the largest number of established non-indigenous reptile and amphibian species in the entire world. Fifty-six are established including three frogs, four turtles, one crocodilian, 43 lizards and five snakes.\n\nResearchers with the USGS Invasive Species Program work collaboratively on all significant groups of invasive organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in all regions of the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 USGS plays an important role in Federal efforts to combat invasive species by providing tools, technology and information to assess, prevent, contain, control, and manage invasive species nationwide. Key components of invasive species activities include prevention, monitoring and forecasting threats, and control and management of established invaders.\n\nFor more information, see the <a href=\"http:\/\/ecosystems.usgs.gov\/invasive\/\">USGS Invasive Species Program<\/a> Web site.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Multi-Media: <\/span><\/strong>\n\n<strong>News Releases &amp; Other Info:<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3087\">USGS News Release: Severe Declines in Everglades Mammals Linked to Pythons<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3066\">USGS News Release: Salt Water Alone Unlikely to Halt Burmese Python Invasion<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fort.usgs.gov\/FLConstrictors\/FAQPrey.asp\">Everglades and Python Prey Study FAQs<\/a>\n\n<strong>Video:<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Title:\u00c2\u00a0<\/strong>Constrictor Snakes\n<strong>Description: <\/strong>Video footage (B-roll) of Everglades National Park biologists hunting and capturing a Burmese Python in Florida.\n\n<strong>URL:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/169\">http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/169<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/logos.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-173251\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/logos-300x111.jpg\" alt=\"Logos of the Research Institutions\" width=\"300\" height=\"111\" \/><\/a>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24171","uid":"31","filename":"Featured-e1328030124407.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Featured-e1328030124407.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"50486","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"77a2748b-8482-439d-8cda-3ec589fb3698","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Biology and Ecosystems","Everglades","Florida","Invasive Species","Pythons"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1328562108","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
