Because not all threats can be seen with satellite images, the editors offer more detailed photos showing a specific feature or species.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis book shows the many ways satellite imagery helps us assess our environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is considerable scientific value in the Landsat imagery we have amassed for this project, which we are hopeful will be of great value to the managers and governmental owners of these critical and unbelievably beautiful places.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong>Place and History <\/strong>\n\nMuch of human history is made up of intangible elements like human actions and activities, philosophical and academic theories, and events both big and small that cannot be recaptured. But many of these ephemeral pieces of our collective memory are embodied by tangible structures and physical features that endure after a moment has passed. These sites may be political monuments like <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/78\">Independence Hall<\/a> in the United States, or great architectural or artistic achievements like Spain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/320\">Works of Antoni Gaudi<\/a> or France\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/320\">Chartres Cathedral<\/a>. They may be places that witnessed history both tragic and triumphant like <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/31\">Auschwitz Birkenau<\/a> or Athens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/404\">Acropolis<\/a>. They may simply stun us with their natural beauty and scale, like Sumatra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tropical rainforest or Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Great Barrier Reef. These places \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all on UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of World Heritage Sites -- are touchstones that we inherit and leave behind; they help us map our universal history.\n\nBut not just one type of satellite could tell the full visual story of these places. In the atlas, <a href=\"http:\/\/landsat.usgs.gov\/\">Landsat<\/a> imagery combines with other higher resolution images from the Quickbird, Ikonos, Corona and Worldview satellites to show a bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye view of the sites in context with their surrounding environment, giving us a broader perspective on how to understand, protect and manage these treasures.\u00c2\u00a0 Other imagery from the Terra and Aqua satellites show coarser pictures, but have a higher temporal frequency, providing imagery of the same location every other day, as opposed to every 16 days for Landsat.\n\nHere are some key examples of those places in <em>From Space to Place<\/em>.\n\n<strong>Garamba National Park<\/strong>\n\nA Landsat image of <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/136\/\">Garamba National Park<\/a> in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows a diverse mosaic of colors representing the many types of habitat that give charismatic animals like the African elephant, giraffe, and hippopotamus a home in the park. Shades of green show different types of forest, while red and brown areas depict savannah grasslands. UNESCO put the park, one of Africa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest protected areas, on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Danger\u00e2\u0080\u009d list\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 1996. Threats include limited management, poaching, civil unrest and species decline.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173559\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"620\" caption=\"Two moderate resolution (30 m) Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images taken in 2002 show the extent of Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and indicate the variety of multicolor habitats it contains.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/SpacetoPlace-Final-23_ts.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-173559\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/03\/SpacetoPlace-Final-23_ts.jpg\" alt=\"See caption:\" width=\"620\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Abu Mena Archaeological Area<\/strong>\n\nEgypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s <a href=\"http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/90\">Abu Mena Archaeological Area<\/a>, which contains remains of an early Christian holy settlement. Built over Menas of Alexandria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomb, a martyr who died in AD 296, the site was added to the list in 2001. The view from the Landsat satellite shows the former pilgrimage center in context of its modern surroundings marked by human settlement and agricultural production. Irrigation has transformed the landscape and changed the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term hydrology, making soil soft and unstable and dissolving the clay that supports the site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buildings, which now are in risk of collapse.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173560\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"620\" caption=\"A pair of moderate resolution (30 m) natural color Landsat images of the area around Abu Mena, in Egypt, from 1984 and 2001 show how the landscape around the site changed in that 17-year period.
