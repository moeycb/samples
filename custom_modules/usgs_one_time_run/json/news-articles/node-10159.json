Peterson will describe these models at the spring meeting of the American Geophysical Union, May 28, in Boston, Mass. \r\n<p>Air temperature is the key factor in the statistical model, according to Peterson, and with the model that he and others have developed, the effect of sudden and sustained temperatures changes can be modeled to predict discharge, or runoff in individual stream basins. \r\n<p>With fresh snow falling as late as May 20 in the California Sierra and air temperatures generally remaining below 60 degrees, this year&rsquo;s runoff will begin later than usual. \r\n<p>Editors: David Peterson will be available for interviews at the Hynes Convention Center, by contacting Marion Fisher in the the AGU newsroom at 617-954-3867. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Massachusetts"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"896241600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
