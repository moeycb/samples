It is obviously beneficial that insectivorous bats are patrolling the skies at night above our fields and forests&nbsp; &mdash;&nbsp; these bats deserve help.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/><span class=\"episode_title_text\">Beyond Billions: Threatened Bats are Worth Billions to Agriculture<\/span>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absMiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audio\/corecast\/ep150\/20110331_150_bats_worth_billions.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=150\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/>or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>The value of the pest-control services to agriculture provided by bats in the U.S. alone range from a low of $3.7 billion to a high of $53 billion a year, estimated the study&rsquo;s authors, scientists from the University of Pretoria (South Africa), USGS, University of Tennessee and Boston University. &nbsp;They also warned that noticeable economic losses to North American agriculture could occur in the next 4 to 5 years as a result of emerging threats to bat populations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bats eat tremendous quantities of flying pest insects, so the loss of bats is likely to have long-term effects on agricultural and ecological systems,&rdquo; said Justin Boyles, a researcher with the University of Pretoria and the lead author of the study. &ldquo;Consequently, not only is the conservation of bats important for the well-being of ecosystems, but it is also in the best interest of national and international economies.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>A single little brown bat, which has a body no bigger than an adult&rsquo;s thumb, can eat 4 to 8 grams (the weight of about a grape or two) of insects each night, the authors wrote. Although this may not sound like much, it adds up&nbsp; &mdash;&nbsp; the loss of the one million bats in the Northeast has probably resulted in between 660 and 1320 metric tons of insects no longer being eaten each year by bats in the region.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Connecticut","Delaware","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","New Hampshire","New Jersey","New York","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","Vermont","Virginia","West Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["white Syndrome","biology","ecosystems","bats","Wind Energy","Wind Power","energy","Wildlife Disease","Bat Declines","agriculture"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1301544000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169020"},{"tid":"169796"},{"tid":"170027"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
