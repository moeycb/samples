For marine mammals, a UME is a stranding that is unexpected, involves a significant die-off of the population, and demands an immediate response.\n\n<strong>Start with Science<\/strong>\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) assembled a team of scientists to investigate. Wildlife experts from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwhc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS National Wildlife Health Center<\/a> contributed their expertise by isolating the virus from the tissues of the seals. They were able to characterize the virus as a type of influenza virus most closely related to the avian influenza H3N8 viruses commonly found in wild birds.\n\nCollectively, the team of scientists determined that the H3N8 seal virus is likely to have caused the 2011 mortality event in New England.\u00c2\u00a0 Further, it may pose a continued threat to marine mammals on the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coast.\u00c2\u00a0 Dr. Hon Ip, a USGS virologist at the National Wildlife Health Center, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was surprising was that the seal virus contained genetic changes that have been shown to increase mammalian infection. Of the influenza viruses that have been previously isolated from seals, none shows this pattern of genetic change toward adapting to mammals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_06_2012\/bfv3AmlYXS_08_06_2012\/medium\/DSCF0277.JPG\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_06_2012\/bfv3AmlYXS_08_06_2012\/medium\/DSCF0277.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" \/><\/a> Katie Pugliares and Michael O'Neil with the New England Aquarium preparing a harbor seal carcass for necropsy.

It is estimated that more than 70 percent of the emerging infectious diseases that can infect people have a wildlife origin. The seal H3N8 virus, and its adaptation to mammals, raises questions about whether this virus may be the latest example of an emerging infectious disease\n\n<strong>Future Efforts for a Healthy Marine Ecosystem <\/strong>\n\nWhile the importance of potential threats to human health and domestic animals from pathogens is of concern, these emerging pathogens are also a potential threat to conservation efforts in regard to maintaining the health of wildlife such as harbor seals and the overall function of a healthy marine ecosystem.\n\nThe National Wildlife Health Center is at the forefront of identifying and understanding disease threats to our native wildlife, as well as sharing that information with public health and domestic animal health agencies.\u00c2\u00a0 Partnerships, such as this effort with the NOAA investigative team, foster better understanding of the epidemiology and ecology of wildlife disease, provide better information for management decisions, and ultimately help protect the health of all species.\n\nThe investigative team from the USGS, Columbia University, NOAA, New England Aquarium, Sea World, and the EcoHealth Alliance recently <a href=\"http:\/\/mbio.asm.org\/content\/3\/4\/e00166-12\">published its findings<\/a> on the influenza virus that fatally afflicted the harbor seals in the scientific journal <em>mBio<\/em>.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_06_2012\/dHxk0NM007_08_06_2012\/medium\/flu_impacted_harbor_seal.JPG\"><img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_06_2012\/dHxk0NM007_08_06_2012\/medium\/flu_impacted_harbor_seal.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" \/><\/a> Dead harbor seal found in New England in 2011.
