This excess nitrate contributes to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone, an area with low oxygen known commonly as the \"dead zone.\" NOAA-supported researchers reported that the summer 2014 dead zone covered about 5,052 square miles, an area the size of Connecticut.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS is using the new sensor technology to collect nitrate concentration data every hour to improve the accuracy of nitrate load estimates to the Gulf of Mexico. The data can also be used to make it easier to detect changes in nitrate levels related to basin management and to track progress toward the goal of reducing the size of the dead zone.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;High frequency data from these sensors has revealed considerable variability in nitrate concentrations in small rivers and streams,&rdquo; said Brian Pellerin, USGS researcher. &ldquo;However, we were surprised to see nitrate concentrations vary by as much as 20 percent in a week in a river as large as the Mississippi River without similar changes in streamflows.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>These rapid changes are very easy to miss with traditional water-quality monitoring approaches. However, hourly information on nitrate levels improves the accuracy and reduces the uncertainty in estimating nitrate loads to the Gulf of Mexico, especially during drought and flood years.<\/p>\r\n<p>This high frequency data also provides new insights into timing and magnitude of nitrate flushing from soils during wet and dry conditions. For instance, the high frequency data revealed high nitrate concentrations during the spring and early summer of both 2013 and 2014 following the drought of 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nitrate sensors on small streams and large rivers throughout the Mississippi River basin are improving our ability track where the pulses are coming from and forecast when they will arrive at the Gulf.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS, in cooperation with numerous local, state, and other federal agencies, currently operates over&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/wqwatch\/\" target=\"_blank\">100 real-time nitrate sensors across the Nation<\/a>.
