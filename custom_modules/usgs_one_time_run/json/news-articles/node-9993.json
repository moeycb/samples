Dak., crews from the U.S. Geological Survey are tracking the northward movement of the water, taking measurements to help improve forecasts of the flood for evacuations upstream. \r\n<p>Records of the flood flows are also vital to engineers and planners who need the information to design safe and effective future flood-control levees, reservoirs and bridges in the area. \r\n<p>Crucial to the understanding of the impact of the flood on upstream communities will be how much water is contributed by the Pembina River, which is the last major tributary into the Red before it enters Canada. Flow of the Pembina River at Neche, North Dak., on April 24, where the USGS maintains a streamflow gaging station, was 10,200 cubic feet per second (cfs) or 6.6 billion gallons per day (bgd) and the gage height is steady due to backwater from the Red River of the North. On April 22, the USGS crews had measured 11,800 cfs (7.6 bgd), which exceeded the previous peak record of 10,700 cfs (6.9 bgd) in 1950. \r\n<p>The USGS North Dakota office has been joined by USGS hydrologic monitoring crews from nine states to keep all phases of the field operation going. Specially trained crews from the USGS water resources office in Kentucky are helping North Dakota crews to install a temporary streamflow gaging station on the Red River at Pembina and will be taking additional measurements using Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler equipment. This sophisticated technology allows hydrologists to measure the velocity of water by bouncing sound waves off of suspended sediments and debris in the river, and then comparing the shift in the frequency of the echoed sound. \r\n<p>The echoed sound -- the Doppler shift -- is not unlike the change in emitted or reflected sound from a car passing a stationary observer; that is, higher in frequency or pitch as the car approaches the observer and lower as the car moves away. In the case of the Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler, sensitive electronic instruments detect the shift in the sound, which is directly proportional to the relative speed of the water and water-borne sediments as the water moves closer to or away from the ADCP. \r\n<p>ADCP discharge or volume measurements are typically made from a boat from which the equipment is suspended in the water. The boat passes across the river while scientists record river velocity and depth using the ADCP. Such measurements are particularly helpful in a flood situation such as that on the Red River because it enables hydrologists to take measurements in the river instead of from stationary points on bridges that are inundated and inaccessible. ADCP measurements are also much quicker than measurements made with standard streamflow measuring equipment. \r\n<p>The crest of the Red River flood is expected to reach the Canadian border on April 27 or 28, according to the river forecast center of the National Weather Service in Minneapolis, Minn. USGS crews will be taking continuous measurements between the North Dakota-South Dakota border and the Canadian border in order to provide accurate data on the volume of the river&rsquo;s flow for the National Weather Service to use in their forecasts of when the Red River will crest at various points along its path northward. \r\n<p>The current estimate of the Red&rsquo;s flow when it reaches the border is 135,000 cfs (87 bgd), according to the NWS river forecast center. When the crest (the highest level the river reaches) reached Grand Forks it was about 130,000 cfs (84 bgd). \r\n<p>The USGS, which maintains a nationwide network of streamflow gaging stations, has 100 gages in North Dakota, 50 of which are in the Red River wa","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["North Dakota"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"861940800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170200"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
