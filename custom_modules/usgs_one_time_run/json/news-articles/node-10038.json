Three lidar surveys were collected using two different systems, the NASA&rsquo;s Experimental Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) and USACE&rsquo;s Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS).<\/p>\n<p>The devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina was observed on Dauphin Island, a barrier island approximately 150 km (90 miles) from where the storm made landfall. Storm surge inundated the island and waves transported sand landward into fan-shaped deposits shifting the entire island landward. Numerous houses, shown in the lidar difference plots as red rectangles, were completely destroyed. NASA has created a series of dissolve animations that illustrate how major storm events can impact and change coastal areas and can be viewed on NASA TV or on the web at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/vision\/earth\/lookingatearth\/katrina_poststorm.html\">http:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/vision\/earth\/lookingatearth\/katrina_poststorm.html<\/a>.
