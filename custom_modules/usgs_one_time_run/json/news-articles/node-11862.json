Uranium and arsenic were two elements consistently detected in the areas disturbed by mining in values above natural background levels.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Analysis of historical water-quality data for more than 1,000 water samples from 428 sites in northern Arizona shows that dissolved uranium concentrations in areas without mining were generally similar to those with active or reclaimed mines. Sixty-six percent of the sampled sites showed low dissolved uranium concentrations (less than 5 parts per billion). Ninety-five percent of the sampled sites had dissolved uranium levels of less than 30 parts per billion, the Environmental Protection Agency maximum for drinking water.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Samples from 15 springs and 5 wells exhibited dissolved uranium concentrations greater than the Environmental Protection Agency maximum for drinking water. These springs and wells are close to or in direct contact with mineralized ore bodies, and concentration levels are related to natural processes, mining, or a combination of both factors.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Almost 100 plants and animals identified by the State of Arizona or other land managers as species of concern inhabit the area proposed for withdrawal. Because uranium and its byproducts such as radon can affect survival, growth, and reproduction of plants and animals, USGS scientists identified exposure pathways (for example, ingestion or inhalation) for these species of concern.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The research efforts undertaken by the U.S. Geological Survey will help decision makers better und","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Arizona"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geography","water","geology","biology","Uranium","Grand Canyon","mining","","Department Of Interior","Salazar","National Park","","Arizona"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1266469200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168826"},{"tid":"169905"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
