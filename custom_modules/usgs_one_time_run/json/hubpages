Under the spirit and provisions of the FOIA, Federal agencies are to make their records available to the public to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>\r\n            <p>FOIA requests for a copy of U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) records can be made by any individual or public or private organization other than a Federal agency.  The request must: (1) be in writing or by e-mail to foia@usgs.gov, (2) specifically cite the Freedom of Information Act, (3) reasonably describe the records sought, and (4) indicate a willingness to pay fees, (specify the amount they are willing to pay) or ask for a fee waiver.  The request will be sent to the USGS FOIA Officer, Mail Stop 807, National Center, Reston, VA  20192.<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Process<\/h3>\r\n            <p>Upon receipt, the FOIA Officer will direct the request to the appropriate USGS FOIA Representative.  The FOIA representative or an assigned liaison officer will respond to the request no later than 20 workdays after receipt, as required by the FOIA statute.  When it is necessary to forward a request to another installation such as a field office for response, the time limit begins upon receipt by the field office.  A time extension, not to exceed an additional 10 workdays, may be taken in certain circumstances.  However, the requester must be notified in writing that an extension is being taken, the reason(s) for taking the extension, and the anticipated date of the FOIA response.<\/p>\r\n            <p>A FOIA response must advise the requester of the records that the bureau intends to disclose or to withhold, the exemption(s) authorizing the withholding (including a citation or summary of each exemption), and a strong justification for withholding the record(s).  Normally the records to be disclosed will be provided with the response letter.  If the records are not provided with the letter, they will be sent as soon as possible thereafter.<\/p>\r\n            <h3>USGS Uses Multi-track Processing of FOIA Requests<\/h3>\r\n            <p>In accordance with 43 CFR 2.26, the USGS uses three processing tracks based on the amount of time required for a request to be processed: Simple, 1-5 workdays, Normal, 20 workdays, and Complex, over 20 workdays. Visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/foia\/news\/guidance\/\">DOI FOIA Guidance<\/a> website for more information.<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Denials<\/h3>\r\n            <p>Headquarters USGS FOIA responses involving a denial or partial denial of records must be coordinated with the FOIA Officer. In the central, eastern and western regions, denials are usually signed by the Regional Geospatial Information Officer (RGIO), after consultation with the regional solicitor.  A denial or partial denial letter will contain a paragraph advising the requester of the right to file an appeal with the Department of the Interior's FOIA Appeals Officer.<\/p>\r\n            <h2>\r\n            Contact\r\n            <\/h2>\r\n            <p>If you have questions on the USGS FOIA process, please contact:<\/p>\r\n            <p><a href=\"mailto:djnewman@usgs.gov\">David J Newman<\/a><br>\r\n              USGS FOIA Officer<br>\r\n              12201 Sunrise Valley Drive<br>\r\n              Mail Stop 807<br>\r\n              Reston, VA 20192<\/p>\r\n          <\/div>","summary":"","format":"php_code"}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24329","uid":"31","filename":"bats_against_sky_by_Paul_Cryan.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/bats_against_sky_by_Paul_Cryan.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"57615","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"4172abaa-7530-41e4-8900-2c0e65f216fe","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":""}]},"links_to":[],"uid":1,"field_top_level_page":{"und":[{"value":1}]},"type":"usgs_node","alias_url":"node\/16379"},"16380":{"title":"Fundamental Science Practices","status":"1","comment":"1","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<div class=\"lead\">\r\n            \t\r\n<p>This unit houses USGS scientific integrity activities.

We adhere to the privacy policies stated below in dealing with children 13 years and younger and for all visitors to USGS Web sites. (for more information see \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/ogc\/coppa1.htm\" title=\"Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"usgs_sitemap_external_link\">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998<\/a>.\"<\/p>\r\n            <p>It is the policy of the USGS that we will not obtain personal identifying information about you when you visit our Web sites, unless you choose to provide the information to us (for example, through a questionnaire in which you willingly provide such information, or in which you are requesting a publication or other information to be transmitted to you by the USGS).<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Identification for Law Enforcement or Unauthorized Use<\/h3>\r\n            <p id=\"enforcement\">The only time that we will attempt to identify individual users or to share any information we receive with any parties outside of the USGS is (1)&nbsp;in the course of officially authorized law enforcement investigations or (2)&nbsp;in the event of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security with the intent to gain <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/disclaimer.cfm\" title=\"DOI Disclaimer Policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"usgs_sitemap_external_link\">unauthorized access<\/a> or to do physical damage (for example, an attack by hackers).  In the latter case, information collected about a suspected intruder may be shared with the USGS Information Technology Security Manager (see Contact information below).<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Web Server Activity<\/h3>\r\n            <p id=\"webserver\">Like most Web servers on the Internet, USGS servers collect and store within Web access logs all of the information that your Web browser sends when it requests a Web page, including:<\/p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>The name, domain, and numerical internet address of the host computer (typically a computer belonging to your Internet Service Provider and not your personal computer) from which you access the Internet; <\/li>\r\n              <li>The date and time you accessed our site; <\/li>\r\n              <li>The Internet address of the Web page that you came from; <\/li>\r\n              <li>The page you requested from our site and the number of characters sent to your computer; and <\/li>\r\n              <li>The information your Web browser software sends as its so-called \u201cUser Agent,\u201d which typically identifies the browser software and may also indicate the operating system used in your personal computer and the type of computer. <\/li>\r\n            <\/ul>\r\n            <p>It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user from this information. The logs are periodically summarized and analyzed to study site usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve the site's organization, performance, and usefulness. Monthly extracts of the log files are archived and stored offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be retained online or offline at our discretion for an indefinite period of time.<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Cookies<\/h3>\r\n            <p id=\"cookies\">Some applications may save a \u201ccookie\u201d on your computer's hard disk to provide a temporary history of actions taken. Cookies are small text files that a web site transfers to your computer to allow the site to remember specific information.

By default, most Web browser software does not send your e-mail address; this option is configured through your browser preferences. <\/p>\r\n            <h3>Online Surveys<\/h3>\r\n            <p id=\"surveys\">When you voluntarily provide us with personal information as part of an online survey, we use it to perform various quantitative and qualitative analyses to improve customer service and satisfaction. We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel to perform the actual analysis. You are under no obligation to participate in such surveys. Non-participation will not inhibit your use of our Web site in any way. If you provided the information to us in error, you may request its removal at any time.

We may forward the information collected to other Government employees or contract personnel or to other computer systems (such as secure electronic commerce servers) to complete the requested transaction.<\/p>\r\n            <h3 id=\"third-party\">Third Party Websites and Applications<\/h3>\r\n            <p>The USGS utilizes some third-party websites and applications that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity and are not subject to the USGS Privacy Policy. Often these technologies are located on a \u201c.com\u201d website or other location that is not part of an official government domain. All users are encouraged to review the applicable third-party privacy policy, evaluate any potential risks and assess periodically thereafter.  Personal Identifiable Information (PII) as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may be minimally collected by USGS to accomplish a purpose required by statute, regulation or executive order. In the event that USGS collects PII from a third-party website or application, the USGS Privacy  Officer must approve the collection, and the public will be notified via a Federal Register comment period which will contain the type of information being collected, the intended purpose of the collection, the retention period, as well as any other specifics.<\/p>\r\n            <h3>Facebook<\/h3>\r\n            <p id=\"facebook\">The USGS maintains official Facebook Pages.
