Additionally, water storage in the Baltimore reservoir system increased by 5 percent to 92 percent of capacity at the end of March. <\/p>\n<p>Streamflow entering the Chesapeake Bay during March also increased to 67.0 bgd (billion gallons per day), but this level is still 21 percent below the long-term average and below-average conditions have persisted since September 2000 (see graphs at http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/monthly\/bay.html). Streamflow at the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., increased by 56 percent over February, but was 26 percent below the long-term average for March. Streamflow at the Choptank River near Greensboro, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore, was 50 percent above normal. <\/p>\r\n<p>Ground-water levels for Maryland and Delaware continued to increase, putting most water levels in the normal range. Twenty new sites have been added to the monthly updates of ground-water conditions for key observation wells in Maryland and Delaware available at: http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/groundwater\/. The graphs show monthly water levels and long-term records for 39 water-table wells and 13 artesian wells. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Delaware","Maryland"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"984200400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170668"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
