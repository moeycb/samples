With the publication of this report, the palila becomes the most thoroughly documented Hawaiian bird species. Topics covered in this extensive report include population dynamics and restoration research, demography and breeding ecology, predator ecology and management, and habitat use, food ecology, and vegetation ecology, and management implications.<\/p>\n<p>The report details how research results can be applied to the conservation of the palila and restoration of its habitat. &ldquo;Some results can be expected to have immediate, practical value; whereas, other information is more likely to enlarge our understanding of the species so that conservation strategies can be adjusted as conditions change,&rdquo; said Paul Banko, USGS biologist and co-editor of the new volume.<\/p>\r\n<p>The major goal of the population and restoration research was to develop methods for reintroducing palila to former range and for enhancing the main palila population on the western slope of Mauna Kea. This work involved evaluating sites where palila could be reintroduced, translocating wild palila to northern Mauna Kea to start a new colony (supplemented by palila bred in captivity by the San Diego Zoo). Translocating palila proved successful in establishing a small breeding colony of palila on the northern slope of Mauna Kea that persisted for a number of years before disappearing during severe drought.<\/p>\r\n<p>A key aspect of the research was documenting the roles of drought and habitat damage by feral sheep in the sharp decline in palila numbers after 2003. One of the outcomes of the decline was the disproportionate number of male palila in the population, suggesting that females suffered greater mortality under stressful conditions. Although palila were found to be at lower risk for mosquito-borne diseases than are most other Hawaiian birds, their reproductive capacity is low, based on studies of the demographic characteristics of the breeding population, productivity of breeding pairs, and nesting success.<\/p>\r\n<p>Introduced predators are a longstanding threat to Hawaiian birds, but before this research little was known about their ecology in upland Mauna Kea, their level of threat to palila, or methods for their control. Radio-telemetry was used to track feral cats, mongooses, and rats to determine home range characteristics and activity and movement patterns. Diet studies revealed the roles of cats and mongooses as bird predators. Surveys revealed that populations of rats were relatively small compared to wet forest habitats and that large outbreaks of mice occasionally occurred. This new knowledge of small mammal ecology was applied to understanding the impacts of these invasive predators on palila and other forest birds and to refining control methods.<\/p>\r\n<p>Due to the palila&rsquo;s extreme dependence on the seeds and other resources provided by a single native tree, m&#257;mane (<em>Sophora chrysophylla<\/em>), its survival critically depends on the availability of that food and the quality of the m&#257;mane habitat. Native <em>Cydia<\/em> caterpillars, which also eat m&#257;mane seeds, were found to be another critical food source for palila, especially nestlings. These topics are discussed in chapters on palila home range characteristics, patterns of habitat use and foraging behavior, seasonal patterns of m&#257;mane flowering and seed set, and threats to m&#257;mane resources from invasive wasps, ants, and beetles. Chemical analyses revealed that m&#257;mane seeds have high nutritional value","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Bird","palila","endangered","Hawaii","Mauna Kea","conservation","biology","Climate Change"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Biology","Climate Change"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1415163600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169055"},{"tid":"170230"},{"tid":"170459"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
