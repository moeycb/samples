Here in Washington, DC, more than half a million people are expected to gather for the annual pyrotechnic extravaganza on the National Mall. Fireworks shows feature spectacular colors, shapes and special effects that would not be possible without minerals! The same minerals that hold up buildings, power smart phones, and provide essential nutrients are the same ones that light up the sky on the Fourth of July.\n\nHere are a <a href=\"http:\/\/minerals.usgs.gov\/west\/morefun.htm\">few examples<\/a> of minerals and the colors they produce in fireworks:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_180582\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Strontium-Red-Fireworks.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-180582 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Strontium-Red-Fireworks.jpg\" alt=\"A side-by-side image of strontium and a red firework exploding against a black background\" width=\"600\" height=\"950\" \/><\/a> A sample of celestite, a common source of strontium, and a red firework.

These fireworks burn a compound known as strontium nitrate, which turns a brilliant red. Strontium\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other main use these days is in ferrite magnets.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_180552\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Copper-Blue-Fireworks.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-180552\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Copper-Blue-Fireworks.jpg\" alt=\"A side-by-side image of copper and a blue firework exploding against a black background\" width=\"360\" height=\"715\" \/><\/a> A blue firework and a sample of native copper, the element that gives blue fireworks their color.

Instead, copper turns fireworks a dazzling blue.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_180572\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"362\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Sodium-Yellow-Fireworks.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-180572\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Sodium-Yellow-Fireworks.jpg\" alt=\"A side-by-side image of sodium and a yellow firework exploding against a black background\" width=\"362\" height=\"690\" \/><\/a> A sample of sodium-rich plagioclase and a yellow firework.

Those exploding suns in the sky that rain a cascade of yellow are burning sodium nitrate.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_180542\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"365\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Barium-Green-Firework.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-180542\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2013\/07\/Barium-Green-Firework.jpg\" alt=\"A side-by-side image of barite and a green firework exploding against a black background\" width=\"365\" height=\"525\" \/><\/a> A green-hued firework and a sample of the mineral barite, a common source of barium.

One of the most common is a cataract of golden sparks, showering down from the main explosion. Those little golden sparks are formed from iron filings, the same things used in your science class to show the direction of a magnetic field.\n\nBrilliant fireworks displays are greatly enhanced thanks to minerals. While enjoying the shows all across the Nation this Fourth, remember to be safe and leave the making of fireworks to the professionals.\n\nAnd for those coming to Washington DC for the show, check out the majestic monuments that surround the National Mall and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/building-stones-of-our-nations-capital\/\">read up<\/a> on where those iconic stones came from.","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24311","uid":"31","filename":"Feature-Image-300x199.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Feature-Image-300x199.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"46201","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"6461a681-99bb-470a-8c25-92a5f4c5c9c8","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["4th of July","Fireworks","Fourth of July","July 4","July 4th","Minerals","National Minerals Information Center"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1372867323","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
