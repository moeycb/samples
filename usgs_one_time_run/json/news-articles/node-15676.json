The U.S. Geological Survey is investing in devices used to continuously measure streamflow and other water data.<!--introend--> Earlier this year, Congress provided $6 million in additional funding for the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nsip\/\">National Streamflow Information Program<\/a>. Idaho&rsquo;s share of that new funding, $141,000, will be applied to 10 streamgages throughout the state.<\/p>\r\n<p>While the streamgages can be used for a variety of purposes by millions of users, one of the most important uses has the potential to save lives and offer huge financial savings by reducing potential economic loss. The National Weather Service will use data from two streamgages in northern Idaho to help protect communities against flooding.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;USGS streamgages are a critical component of our river forecast and flood warning program,&rdquo; said NWS hydrologist Katherine Rowden, &ldquo;The data provided by streamgages on the Pack River near Colburn and the St. Joe River at St. Maries will help us deliver forecasts and warnings to those areas.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Two other streamgages that will be supported by the new USGS NSIP funding&mdash;one on the Snake River near Murphy and one on the Little Lost River near Howe&mdash;are critical to Idaho Department of Water Resources allocations of water for agricultural and hydroelectric production.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Little Lost River streamgage is important for the distribution of irrigation water in Water District 33,&rdquo; said IDWR&rsquo;s Rick Raymondi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also near the eastern Snake Plain aquifer model boundary, so data from that streamgage will improve the accuracy of the model water budget in that area. The Snake River near Murphy streamgage is important for administering water rights as defined in the Swan Falls Settlement Agreement between the state of Idaho and Idaho Power Company. The flows measured there are closely watched by the state, Idaho Po","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Idaho"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["streamgage","water","flooding","waterquality","congress","","Idaho",""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1410148800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170582"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
