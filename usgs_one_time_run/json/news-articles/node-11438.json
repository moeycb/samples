Jawad. \"The survey data being revealed here today will help identify fault lines to assess any potential hazard risks as well as the potential location and quantity of undiscovered water, oil and gas, and non-fuel mineral resources, providing invaluable new information to present to both public and private stakeholders as we all work together toward the rebuilding of Afghanistan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Afghanistan has significant natural resource potential, but much of the country's potential remains unknown,\" said USGS Director Mark Myers. \"The geophysical survey provides objective, unbiased information and will enable scientists to better define areas for future exploration and development.\" \r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\"><span class=\"episode_title_text\">Significant Potential for Undiscovered Resources in Afghanistan<\/span><\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absMiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep18\/afghan_min_final.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ID=47\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/>or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists collected aerial photographs and geophysical data, which includes aeromagnetic and gravity data. Researchers combined the geophysical data with data from previous studies to create a magnetic anomaly map and a gravity anomaly map of Afghanistan.<\/p>\r\n<p>Airborne magnetic surveys provide a way to see through surface layers, such as sand, vegetation and water. They are a powerful tool for documenting the distribution and relative abundance of magnetic minerals in rocks - information that can help with mineral and petroleum exploration, tectonic interpretations, and seismic hazard assessments. Airborne gravity surveys help identify igneous rocks (rocks produced through intense heat) of interest for mineral resource studies, sedimentary basins for petroleum and water resource studies, and linear features for seismic hazard studies. The aerial photographs have many geologic and civil uses. They can help with the inventory and planning of civil infrastructure and agricultural resources and the development of detailed maps.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this effort, USGS scientists worked cooperatively with the Naval Research Laboratory, Afghanistan Geological Survey, A","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1209528000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169775"},{"tid":"169633"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
