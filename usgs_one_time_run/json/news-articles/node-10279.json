In addition, fires set by Native Americans and European settlers have influenced vegetation patterns in the Southeast for centuries. \n<p>The effects of fire are not subtle. Frequent fire can dramatically change the structure of a forest; for example, it can change a forest from one with thick underbrush to one with a parklike, cathedral structure. But while fire is essential to the maintenance of some ecosystems, it has long been viewed solely as a destructive force that needs to be controlled. Over the past several centuries, extensive fire suppression efforts have been one of the most pervasive human impacts on the natural ecosystems of this region, and, according to fire ecologists, altered fire regimes have contributed to the current threatened status of a number of native habitats in the southern United States. \r\n<p>The importance of fire in managing public lands in the Southeast has long been recognized. The largest controlled burn programs in the National Park System are carried out in this region of the United States in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Florida. Prescribed burning on public lands can help maintain the Southeast&rsquo;s unique species and ecosystems, and reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfires. \r\n<p>However much remains to be learned about the effects of fire -- both natural and manmade -- on southeastern woodlands, wetlands and coastal prairies. USGS scientists are studying the fire ecology of the Southeast from a variety of perspectives. Efforts are under way to understand the complex ecological effects of natural fires, such as the massive North Florida fires of 1998, and to determine how fire may best be applied as a management tool to maintain the diversity and vitality of systems in which the natural fire regime has been disrupted. \r\n<p><b>North Florida<\/b> \r\n<p>In the summer of 1998, recalls USGS ecologist Dr. Sue Grace, much of North and Central Florida was ablaze. The disastrous Florida fire season that year was largely the result of an unusual sequence of climatic conditions linked to El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o. The previous winter had been warm and exceptionally wet, stimulating plant growth and limiting the ability of managers to reduce fuel loads through controlled burning. \r\n<p>This pattern changed abruptly with the onset of a severe drought in the spring of 1998. Areas that were too wet for managed burns a few months before quickly became too dry. Lightning activity increased in early summer, but with little accompanying rainfall. In the end, says Grace, the fuel conditions and the weather conditions created a catastrophic event. Throughout June and July some 2,500 fires, many of severe intensity, burned roughly half a million acres of the Florida landscape. \r\n<p>In the fall of 1998, Grace, of the USGS National Wetlands Research Center, joined an interagency team of scientists formed under the leadership of the USGS and the U.S. Forest Service with support from the federal Joint Fire Science Board. The research team, which included representatives from a number of federal and state agencies as well as private institutions, had been mobilized to rapidly assess and study the ecological and economic impacts of the Florida wildfires. \r\n<p>Over the past year Grace&rsquo;s work has focused on how native and exotic plant species have responded in the aftermath of the severe wildfire. Of particular concern have been two categories of plants: endemic species, whose only existing populations occur in Florida, and exotic or non-native species, which often have the potential to invade new areas in the wake of a severe disturbance. \r\n<p>Grace says","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alabama","Florida","Georgia","Louisiana","Mississippi","Texas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"937540800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168875"},{"tid":"169015"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
