However, some projections of future human-induced change exceed documented natural variability.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The past tells us that when thresholds in the climate system are crossed, climate change can be very large and very fast. We cannot rule out that human induced climate change will trigger such events in the future.<\/p>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>\"By integrating research on the past 65 million years of climate change in the entire circum-Arctic, we have a better understanding on how climate change affects the Arctic and how those effects may impact the whole globe,\" said USGS Director Mark Myers. \"This report provides the first comprehensive analysis of the real data we have on past climate conditions in the Arctic, with measurements from ice cores, sediments and other Earth materials that record temperature and other conditions.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>To view the full report, titled <em>Synthesis and Assessment Product 1.2: Past Clima","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","Global","Warming","Climate Change","erosion","glaciers","permafrost"],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1232082000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169674"},{"tid":"169633"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
