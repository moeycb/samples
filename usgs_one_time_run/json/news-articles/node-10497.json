The earth ruptured for about 300 miles along the San Andreas Fault throughout Northern California, both on land and where it extends offshore. The earthquake and fires that followed caused catastrophic damage to cities and towns throughout the region and had a dramatic impact on the culture and history of California. The event also initiated national interest in study of earthquakes and disaster prevention. <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>WHO: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<p>Joint press conference of the USGS and the Earthquake Conference with scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, and URS Corp.<\/p><\/BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<p><strong>WHAT: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<p>Scientists will show maps and animations of the intensity of shaking throughout the region for the 1906 earthquake and will describe the two-year scientific effort behind these computer simulations.
