More than 1,000 scientists, managers, and policymakers will gather in Sacramento to discuss the latest advances in scientific information and ideas on water resource management in the Delta, its watershed, and the San Francisco Estuary.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Policies addressing California&rsquo;s current drought, ensuring long-term water supplies, and protecting the health of the Bay-Delta environment must be based on the best available science,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/whoweare\/depsec.cfm\">Mike Connor, Deputy Secretary of the Interior<\/a>&nbsp;and the department&rsquo;s lead water policymaker. &ldquo;The Department of the Interior commends the Delta Stewardship Council and USGS for setting up this conference to bring decision makers together with scientists.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is a major conference that highlights the most recent discoveries that influence management decisions on the Delta,&rdquo; said <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/deltacouncil.ca.gov\/science-program\/about-science-program\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Dr. Peter Goodwin<\/span><\/a><\/span>, lead scientist for the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/deltacouncil.ca.gov\/science-program\/about-science-program\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Delta Science Program<\/span><\/a><\/span>. &ldquo;These discoveries include: how to anticipate and prepare for severe storms; assessing the risk of mercury impacts and new ways to minimize those impacts; and the importance of floodplains as fish food producers.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Delta, formed by the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, is the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas, the hub of both the state and federal water projects, and a region of agriculture and recreational importance. These often conflicting uses have bedeviled policy makers and scientists for decades.<\/p>\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s theme is &ldquo;Making Connections<em>,<\/em>&rdquo; in the spirit of &ldquo;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/deltacouncil.ca.gov\/science-program\/one-delta-one-science-%E2%80%93-path-building-common-knowledge\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">One Delta, One Science<\/span><\/a><\/span>,&rdquo; and highlights how management of the Bay-Delta ecosystem is at a critical juncture. Political and regulatory mandates require new ways of managing water exports while also restoring landscape-level ecosystem attributes and functions. To support these activities, scientists must make connections among the external forces that impact the system, management actions, and ecosystem responses. Equally critical is a two-way flow of communication between scientists and managers to better understand their respective needs, available resources, and ideas.<\/p>\r\n<p>The conference will be held at the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sacramentoconventioncenter.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sacramento Convention Center<\/span><\/a><\/span>, 1400 J Street, and begins with a plenary session at 9:00 a.m. on October 28.
