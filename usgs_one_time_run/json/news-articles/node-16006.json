As of this writing, 325 people in 138 cities throughout Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Georgia, Syria, and the surrounding region had responded on the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/dyfi\/events\/us\/b0006bqc\/us\/index.html\">Did You Feel It?<\/a> website.\n\n<strong>History of strong earthquakes<\/strong>\n\nTurkey is a tectonically active country that experiences frequent destructive earthquakes. This earthquake is a reminder of the many deadly seismic events that Turkey has suffered in the recent past.\n<ul>\n\t<li>In 1999, a devastating magnitude-7.6 \u00c2\u00a0earthquake near Izmit broke a section of the North Anatolian Fault (approximately 620 miles to the west of the October 23, 2011, earthquake), killing 17,000 people, injuring 50,000, and leaving 500,000 homeless.<\/li>\n\t<li>In 1976, a magnitude-7.3 earthquake struck near the border of Turkey and Iran (approximately 40 miles from the October 23, 2011, earthquake), destroying several villages and killing 3,000 to 5,000 people.<\/li>\n\t<li>In 1939, a magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck near Erzincan, killing an estimated 33,000 people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Tectonics of this earthquake<\/strong>\n\nOn a broad scale, earthquakes in this region are controlled by the collision of the Arabian Plate and Eurasian tectonic plates. At the latitude of this event, the Arabian plate converges with Eurasia in a northerly direction at a rate of approximately 24 millimeters per year.\n\nIn the area of Lake Van and further east, tectonic activity is dominated by the Bitlis Suture Zone (in eastern Turkey) and Zagros fold and thrust belt (which extends toward Iran). This earthquake occurred beyond the eastern extent of Anatolian <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?term=strike-slip\">strike-slip<\/a> faulting, which is similar to the San Andreas Fault in California. The focal mechanism of this earthquake is consistent with <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?termID=59\">oblique-thrust faulting<\/a> similar to mapped faults in the region.\n\nFor the most recent information on this earthquake, maps, and scientific and technical information, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/eqinthenews\/2011\/usb0006bqc\/#details\">Magnitude 7.2 - Eastern Turkey<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"60\" caption=\"Flash animation of a strike-slip fault\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/animation.php?flash_title=Strike-slip+Fault+Flash+Animation&amp;flash_file=strikeslip&amp;flash_width=240&amp;flash_height=310\"><img src=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/images\/thumbnails\/strikeslip.gif\" alt=\"Flash animation of a strike-slip fault\" width=\"60\" height=\"50\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"60\" caption=\"Flash animation of a thrust fault\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/animation.php?flash_title=Thrust+Fault+Flash+Animation&amp;flash_file=thrustfault&amp;flash_width=220&amp;flash_height=320\"><img src=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/animations\/images\/thumbnails\/thrustfault.gif\" alt=\"Flash animation of a thrust fault\" width=\"60\" height=\"50\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n&nbsp;","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24159","uid":"31","filename":"Turkey-earthquake.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Turkey-earthquake.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"183755","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"6d801155-9106-4426-8ac2-40e51372baa0","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1319491184","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
