This would be enough natural gas to heat more than 100 million average homes for 10 years, according to current usage rates provided by the Energy Information Administration. However, further research, including long-term production tests, still is needed to demonstrate gas hydrates as an economically producible resource.<!--introend--><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Dirk Kempthorne","Alaskan North Slope","assessment","naturalgashydrates","hydrates"],"article_type":["Department of Interior","National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1226466000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169680"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
