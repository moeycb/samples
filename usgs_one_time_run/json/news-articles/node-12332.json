She has made important contributions to the understanding of earthquake physics and earthquake triggering, the physical properties and geometry of earthquake fault zones and their evolution after earthquakes, and to the development of a new method of earthquake monitoring using low-cost earthquake sensors, called the Quake-Catcher Network (QCN). This network allows scientists to monitor earthquakes and quantify ground shaking with unprecedented spatial resolution through data gathered from citizen volunteers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is inspiring to see the innovative work being done by these scientists and engineers as they ramp up their careers &mdash; careers that I know will be not only personally rewarding but also invaluable to the Nation,&rdquo; President Obama said.&nbsp;&ldquo;That so many of them are also devoting time to mentoring and other forms of community service speaks volumes about their potential for leadership, not only as scientists but as model citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Presidential early career awards embody the high priority the Obama Administration places on producing outstanding scientists and engineers to advance the Nation&rsquo;s goals, tackle grand challenges, and contribute to the American economy.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is an incredible honor to receive this award, and it is nice that it recognizes the combination of research and education,&rdquo; said Cochran, who was nominated for the award by the National Science Foundation. &ldquo;I am very proud and a little stunned.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dr. Cochran&rsquo;s work on next generation sensor networks is exactly what the United States needs to help&nbsp;enable earthquake early warning,&rdquo; said USGS Director Dr. Marcia McNutt. &ldquo;As was clearly demonstrated by the recent Japanese experience, even a few seconds of warning before an earthquake can reduce the loss of life and property. Dr. Cochran&rsquo;s innovative research will help make the nation safer from this natural hazard.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The QCN, a collaborative research project between Cochran and Jesse Lawrence of Stanford University, uses computers that are installed with software and special sensors to record moderate-to-large&nbsp;earthquakes and aftershocks. Citizen volunteers have the sensors installed externally to their desktop&nbsp;computers or internally to their laptop computers. These computers become seismic stations by providing the physical infrastructure, computer, internet connection, power, and the location and measurement of seismic activity. The computers are then networked using distributed computing techniques that allow scientists to monitor the sensors and retrieve earthquake data automatically. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Quake-Catcher Network is a way to involve the public in scientific data collection in high-risk earthquake and aftershock zones in the United States and around the world and to collect seismic data in non-traditional ways,&rdquo; said Cochran.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"25","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","earthquake","Quake Catcher","","award","Cochran"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1317700800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169087"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
