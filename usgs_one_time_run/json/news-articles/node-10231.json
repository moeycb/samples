These data proved critical in verifying that a flood of the Lago La Plata Reservoir was not impending. \n<p>At the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency (PREMA) during the hurricane, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 M. Agis and Maritza Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez monitored the USGS rain gauge network. Dianne L\u00c3\u00b3pez and Reynaldo Sanabria remained in the Caribbean District office to monitor the computer system and respond to any request from the emergency unit at the PREMA. \r\n<p>Even though Hurricane Lenny did not make landfall on the island, it produced heavy rains over Puerto Rico, especially in the interior and the southeast portion of the island. The USGS rain gauge network reported 24-hour rainfall totals of up to 5 and 6 inches near Orocovis, in the interior of the island and approximately 3 inches in the southeastern towns of Naguabo and Humacao. Numerous landslides have also been reported in these areas. \r\n<p>The USGS maintains a network of 123 gaging stations in the Caribbean that measure river stage (height) and discharge (volume). During normal operations these stations transmit every 4 hours and the data is available to the general public on the Internet <a href=\"http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov<\/a>. In Puerto Rico, this information is used on a regular basis to forecast water availability for drinking in addition to agricultural and industrial uses.
