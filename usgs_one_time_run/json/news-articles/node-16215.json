<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=3463\">coastal erosion<\/a>, her team was able to predict where the natural protective sand barriers would be worn away and thus where the storm surges and hurricane waves would likely cause the most damage.\u00c2\u00a0 This information, as well as assessments of coastal erosion hazards during future storms, is vital in helping resource managers and coastal planners identify the most vulnerable areas along the shoreline and address the public safety concerns of their residents.\n\nIn her time at USGS, she has also studied the impacts of Hurricanes Isabel, Ivan, Katrina, and Ike on barrier island beaches.\u00c2\u00a0 Her work on the effects of these storms on the coastal communities of our Nation has raised public awareness about the value of scientific information on coastal vulnerability, helping residents prepare for future storms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"199\"]<a

how and why some desert communities are more vulnerable than others to factors such as climate change, invasive species and dust production.\u00c2\u00a0 In more than 25 years of service, she has published 245 peer-reviewed articles and books on soil crusts.\n\nBelnap, a leader and expert in her field, conducts training for Federal, State, and private land managers on how best to manage dryland ecosystems.\u00c2\u00a0 She is world-renowned for her expertise on biological soil crusts and has been invited by many foreign governments to train their scientists in soil crust ecology,

scientists still refer to her work today.\u00c2\u00a0 She also studied the water resources of the Philadelphia region.\u00c2\u00a0 Along with her service in the USGS, Bascom also taught at Bryn Mawr College beginning in 1895 and was the founder of their geology department.\u00c2\u00a0 Many American women geologists of the early 20<sup>th<\/sup> century owed their professional training to Bascom; several of them followed in her footsteps by joining the USGS themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>A Legacy of Excellence<\/strong>\n\nThese are just a few of the impressive women throughout the history of the USGS to serve our Nation and the world with relevant, high-quality scientific data and information.\u00c2\u00a0 With the help of their teams and colleagues, they shape the future of the USGS,
