Despite this history of earthquakes the faults on which these earthquakes are occurring are poorly known, and scientists do not have a clear understanding of the causes of earthquakes in the eastern U.S. Scientists are using seismic data from the August 2011 M5.8 Virginia earthquake to answer some of these questions and to refine estimates of the of the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seismic hazard.

The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic; speakers are encouraged to thoroughly explain the subject matter and to define any words or terms that may be unfamiliar. The USGS lecture series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_174882\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"388\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/08\/Screen-Shot-2012-08-28-at-1.38.46-PM.png\"><\/a> This map shows recorded earthquakes in the central and eastern United States lain over the USGS earthquake hazard maps.[\/caption] Last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s M5.8 Virginia earthquake came as a surprise for many in the area, but in the past 400 years, there have been more than 30 damaging earthquakes in the eastern U.S., ranging from the M6.0 near Boston in 1755, to M7.3 in Charleston, S.C. in 1886.
