The Patuxent Research Refuge, also within the DOI, is part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Patuxent conservation science campus is co-located on more than 12,750 acres of wildlife habitat in the Baltimore\u00e2\u0080\u0093Washington corridor.\n\nThe USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the USFWS Patuxent Research Refuge continue to play critical roles in education, outreach, and the development of wildlife conservation science.\n\nThrough the decades, Patuxent's scientists have been responsible for many important advances in natural resource conservation and have had global impact with research and partnerships in 76 countries on all seven continents.\n<h4><strong>Today<\/strong><\/h4>\n<strong><\/strong>Seventy-five years later, wildlife conservation science is again at a crossroads.\n\nClimate change, water availability, changes in land use, renewable energy development, and urbanization present new challenges to conservation programs.
