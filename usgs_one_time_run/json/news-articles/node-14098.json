Kawili Street, in Hilo. A map of the campus is <a href=\"http:\/\/hilo.hawaii.edu\/images\/maps\/main_campus_map.pdf\">online<\/a>.&nbsp; This free presentation begins at 7:00 p.m.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Wes Thelen, the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory's seismic network manager, will present \"Large earthquakes in the Hawaiian Islands: What you need to know\" in the K&#299;lauea Visitor Center auditorium on Crater Rim Drive, in Hawai&lsquo;i Volcanoes National Park, at 7:00 p.m.&nbsp; This \"After Dark in the Park\" presentation is free, but Park entrance fees apply.<\/p>\r\n<p>Large earthquakes pose an ever-present danger to Hawaii.&nbsp; Since 1868, more than 30 magnitude-6.0 or greater earthquakes have impacted residents throughout the State.&nbsp; The probability that another destructive &mdash;magnitude 6.5 or higher&mdash; earthquake will strike the Hawaiian Islands in the next 10 years is 50 percent; in the next 20 years, the probability increases to 75 percent.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">According to Okubo, while the Island of Hawai&lsquo;i experiences more seismicity than other Hawaiian islands, the exposure to earthquake risk spans the entire State of Hawaii.&nbsp; As a recent example, he notes that the October 2006 magnitude-6.7 and 6.0 earthquakes, located in West Hawai&lsquo;i, caused $200 million in damages on the Islands of Hawai&lsquo;i and Maui, as well as an extended power outage on O&lsquo;ahu.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Thelen points out that it has been 40 years since a destructive earthquake occurred during business and school hours&mdash;the magnitude-6.2 Honom&#363;, Hawai&lsquo;i earthquake on April 26, 1973.&nbsp; Without that experience, conducting drills is even more important for all schools and businesses, as well as individuals and families, to practice \"Drop! Cover! Hold on!\"&mdash;actions that are proven to reduce injury in an earthquake&mdash;during the <a href=\"http:\/\/shakeout.org\/hawaii\/\">Great Hawaii ShakeOut<\/a> earthquake drill on October 17.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both Okubo and Thelen will present an overview of damaging earthquakes in Hawaii, including current theories on why they occur.&nbsp; They will also talk about \"The <a href=\"http:\/\/shakeout.org\/hawaii\/\">Great Hawaii ShakeOut<\/a>\" and what people can do to protect themselves during Hawaii&rsquo;s next large earthquake.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information about these two presentations, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/hvo.wr.usgs.gov\">HVO website<\/a> or call (808) 967-8844.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" id=\"gallery_news\" name=\"NR2013_09_26\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photo_shares\/thumbs\/tags\/NR2013_09_26\/1\" title=\"Image Gallery\"><\/iframe>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["earthquake","Hawaii","Drop Cover Hold On","Shake Out","lecture","National Park","volcano"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"distribution":["Natural Hazards"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1380168000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169558"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
