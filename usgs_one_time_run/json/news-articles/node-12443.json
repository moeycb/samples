Previously, the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash was responsible for responding to volcanic unrest at some northern California volcanoes.<\/p>\r\n<p>CalVO replaces the former Long Valley Observatory, established in 1982 to monitor the restless Long Valley Caldera and Mono-Inyo Craters region of California. The creation of CalVO will improve coordination with federal, state, and local emergency managers during volcanic crises, and create new opportunities for volcanic hazard awareness and preparedness. The realignment of USGS Volcano Observatories will further facilitate collaboration with federal and state partner agencies including the California Emergency Management Agency and the California Geological Survey.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"California has always led the nation in comprehensive planning for potential disasters. Having the USGS take the initiative to enhance their volcanic threat capabilities and, most importantly, improve planning and coordination with California's emergency managers is welcomed news.&nbsp; At the end of the day, the public expects us to plan for all hazards, and this is another great example,\" said Mike Dayton, Undersecretary of the California Emergency Management Agency.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"California is the most geologically diverse state in the nation. We are known for our earthquakes, landslides and flood hazards. But our nearly forgotten hazard is our volcanoes,\" said Dr. John Parrish, the State Geologist of California. \"The California Geological Survey welcomes the new CalVO with its expanded scope and organization, and we look forward to its successful operations. The new CalVO will streamline our emergency response operations since CGS has offices at the USGS Menlo Park complex, and CalVO&rsquo;s authority now encompasses all of California's volcanic provinces in one center.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">In 2005, the USGS issued an assessment entitled \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2005\/1164\/\">Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States\" (USGS OFR 2005-1164)<\/a>.
