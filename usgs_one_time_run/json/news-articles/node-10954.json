Just maybe, for our non-Icelandic audience, we need to explain. These are not typos. They are just four of the geographic names, gleaned from literature dating back to 13th century Icelandic sagas, for Iceland&rsquo;s 269 modern named glaciers.<!--introend-->&nbsp; Science fiction readers (and movie goers) will quickly identify Sn&aelig;fellsj&ouml;kull as the glacier-capped volcano whose summit crater was the entry point in Jules Verne&acute;s Journey to the Center of the Earth. The ice-margin glacial lake, J&ouml;kuls&aacute;rl&oacute;n, in front of the Brei&eth;amerkurj&ouml;kull outlet glacier from Iceland&acute;s largest ice cap, was the setting for sequences in two of the James Bond movies.<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"185\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-10-24\/book_cover.jpg\" alt=\"Publication Cover\" width=\"180\" height=\"233\" \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span class=\"fontSize2\"><span class=\"fontSize1\">Oblique aerial photograph of S&oacute;lheimaj&ouml;kull, an outlet glacier on the southern margin of M&Yacute;RDALSJ&Ouml;KULL, with black tephra from the 1918 eruption of Katla.

It includes descriptions, a striking array of aerial and ground photographs, satellite images, maps, geographic coordinates, and bibliographic citations for the use of all glacier place-names on published maps and in the literature to document each of the 269 modern-named glaciers of Iceland.<\/p>\r\n<p>To produce this book, authors Oddur Sigur&eth;sson of the Hydrological Service of Iceland&acute;s National Energy Authority (NEA) and Richard S. Williams, Jr. of the Woods Hole Science Center of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) combed through the long and unique history that Icelanders have been observing their glaciers. According to Sigur&eth;sson, \"Some of the glaciers were named more than a millennium ago, although the written record only dates back about eight centuries.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>For hundreds of years, changes in the glaciers were observed and documented in historic annals by local residents. The first published national record of Icelandic glaciers dates back 300 years.&nbsp; Since 1930, scientists and lay people, under the successive leadership of J&oacute;n Ey&thorn;&oacute;rsson, Sigurj&oacute;n Rist, and Oddur Sigur&eth;sson have made systematic annual measurements of fluctuations in many glaciers in Iceland.<\/p>\r\n<p>Iceland has an impressive array of glaciers for a nation with an area about the size of the Commonwealth of Virginia (40,000 sq. mi. or 103,000 sq. km.). The modern-named glaciers include: 16 ice caps, 109 outlet glaciers, 8 ice-flow basins, 3 ice streams, 55 cirque glaciers, 73 mountain glaciers, and 5 valley glaciers.&nbsp; Iceland also has 21 surge-type glaciers and 38 named snow patches.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Geographic Names of Iceland&rsquo;s Glaciers: Historic and Modern<\/em> is the seco","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["glaciers","Iceland"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1224820800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"},{"tid":"170322"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
