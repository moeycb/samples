The current level of natural gas development in much of the country, and its effects on the landscape, is an important contemporary land-use\/land-cover issue. <br \/><br \/>\"Large-scale landscape disturbance can have a significant impact on ecological resources and the services they provide. &nbsp;This study provides a quantitative look at the levels of disturbance, forest loss and other changes to land use and land cover,\" said Terry Slonecker, lead author of the research. <br \/><br \/>These data will be used to assess the effects of disturbance and land-cover change on wildlife, water quality, invasive species and socioeconomic impacts, among other investigations. &nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Because of their underlying geology, Bradford and Washington counties are exceptionally productive areas of Marcellus Shale natural gas development and were specifically chosen for this initial report.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>The study found that in Bradford County, 642 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 1500 hectares of disturbance, including 74 kilometers (45 miles) of new roads and 178 kilometers (110 miles) of new pipelines. <br \/><br \/>In Washington County, 949 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 1800 hectares of disturbance, including 277 kilometers (172 miles) of new roads and 216 kilometers (134 miles) of new pipelines. <br \/><br \/>The study, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/of\/2012\/1154\/\">Landscape Consequences of Natural Gas Extraction in Bradford and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania, 2004 to 2010<\/a>,\" Open File Report 2012-1154, is the first of a series planned relating to natural gas landscape disturbance.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Pennsylvania"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Geographic Areas Northeast","Landscape Science"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1346817600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169472"},{"tid":"170559"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
