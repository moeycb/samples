Although the EPA criteria provide flexibility for the use of local data, they are currently applied at all beaches when determining whether to close a beach or issue a swimming advisory, regardless of whether there is a sewage source.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"By basing their beach closure decisions on local variations in bacteria concentrations, beach managers likely will be able to keep their beaches open more often, without increasing the presumed health risk or violating the EPA guidelines,\" said Meredith Nevers, a scientist with the USGS Lake Michigan Ecological Research Station. \"Our goal is to make local beach managers fully aware of the flexibility that the EPA is providing in its current guidelines.\"<em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS study examined historic monitoring data from 50 Lake Michigan beaches in Illinois and Indiana. New calculations using local monitoring results for the 50 sites indicated that the current applications may be more conservative than necessary for these and most coastal beaches across the country.<\/p>\r\n<p>The EPA is expected to release new recreational water quality criteria in October 2012 that, like the current guidelines, will apply to all coastal marine and Great Lakes beaches.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Great Lakes Science Center<\/a> research was funded by the USGS Ocean Research Priorities Plan and the <a href=\"http:\/\/cida.usgs.gov\/glri\/\">Great Lakes Restoration Initiative<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The article, published in the journal <em>Environmental Science and Technology<\/em>, can be downloaded <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/es202568f?prevSearch=%255BAllField%253A%2B%255BAllField%253A%2BMeredith%2BNevers%255D%255D&amp;searchHistoryKey=\">here<\/a> (PDF).&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Illinois","Indiana"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Great Lakes","water","beaches"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1325566800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169502"},{"tid":"170113"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
