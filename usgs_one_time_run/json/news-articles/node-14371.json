You also see parts of the open Ponderosa Pine forest and high desert on the eastern slopes of the mountains.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail is a treasured pathway through some of the most scenic terrain in the nation. Beginning in southern California at the Mexican border, the PCT travels a total distance of 2,650 miles through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304733\">California<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304735\">Oregon<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/detail\/pct\/home\/?cid=stelprdb5304737\">Washington<\/a> until reaching the Canadian border. The PCT is one of the original National Scenic Trails established by Congress in the 1968 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/nts\/legislation.html\">National Trails System Act<\/a> and fifty-four percent of the trail lies within designated wilderness.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS partnered with the&nbsp;U.S. Forest Service to incorporate the trail onto the Oregon US Topo maps. This NST joins the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/iatr\/index.htm\">Ice Age National Scenic Trail<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.usda.gov\/pnt\/\">Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/noco\/index.htm\">North Country National Scenic Trail<\/a> as being featured on the new US Topo quads. The USGS hopes to eventually include all National Scenic Trails in <em>The National Map<\/em> products.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>These new maps replace the first edition US Topo maps for Oregon and are available for free download from <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/\"><em>The National Map<\/em><\/a> and the USGS Map Locator &amp; Downloader <a href=\"http:\/\/store.usgs.gov\/b2c_usgs\/usgs\/maplocator\/(ctype=areaDetails&amp;xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&amp;carea=%24ROOT&amp;layout=6_1_61_48&amp;uiarea=2)\/.do\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Another important addition to the new Oregon US Topo maps in the inclusion of <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalatlas.gov\/articles\/boundaries\/a_plss.html\">Public Land Survey System<\/a>.
