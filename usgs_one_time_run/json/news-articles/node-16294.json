Watching Over Earth<\/strong> Of course, USGS is best known for training its eye on the changes and rhythms of Planet Earth. Much of this work is thanks to <strong>the Landsat Missions<\/strong>, a joint program between USGS and NASA, wherein the USGS operates satellites that help us scan the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface for natural and man-made changes. The first satellite, Landsat 1, was launched in 1972, and the latest mission, Landsat 8, celebrated its first birthday on February 11, 2014. The Landsat missions have now collected over 42 years of global land imagery data. One benefit of this incredible record is the ability to visualize landscape conditions, such as <strong>drought impacts to California<\/strong>. The decrease of winter snow cover in the Sierra Nevada Mountains can be seen in this progression of images, captured by Landsat in February 2011, 2013, and 2014. California is heavily dependent on large Sierra Nevada snowpacks to replenish its annual water supply and sustain its vast agricultural lands and diverse ecosystems, and this satellite record underscores the current water shortage plight of the Golden State.

Dreaming of Streams in Green<\/strong> USGS operates about 7,400 streamgages around the United States, including this gage photographed in August 2014 in the serene, verdant woods of Little Back Creek, located within the George Washington National Forest in Virginia. You can find this photo in the USGS Flickr gallery. (Photo Credit: Alan Cressler\/USGS) Streamgages are operated by the <strong>USGS National Streamflow Information Program (NSIP)<\/strong>, whose mission is to provide real-time streamflow data to local, state, regional, and national leaders, so communities can continuously monitor changes in their local waters, track drought and flood conditions, and manage accordingly.\n<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/on.doi.gov\/LittleBackCreek\"><strong>Check the current stream conditions of Little Back Creek<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nsip\/\"><strong>Look for other stream gages operated by the USGS National Streamflow Information Program<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/celebrating-the-first-usgs-streamgage\/\"><strong>Celebrate the first-ever USGS streamgage<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/usgeologicalsurvey\/15241108307\/\"><strong>Search for this and other beautiful images at the USGS Flickr page<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/02\/WindFarm-Map-Screenshot-1024x581.jpg\"><\/a><strong>11. Interactive Energy<\/strong> Investigating natural sources of energy has always been a task for USGS, helping our nation study and assess the location, quantity, and quality of energy resources, including the economic and environmental effects of resource extraction and use. From the exploration assessment of oil and natural gas to habitat restoration after dam removals, USGS has evolved with the changing needs and considerations of energy use in the United States. In February 2014, USGS unveiled <strong>windFarm<\/strong>, an interactive app mapping wind energy turbines around the United States, visualizing a never-before-assembled national dataset for anyone to access online. Knowing the location of individual turbines, their make, model, height, blade area, and capacity offers important information for land and resource managers and scientists studying wildlife-turbine collisions or interactions between wind turbines and ground-based radar.

From a Polar Bear Point of View<\/strong> This is no footage from a soda pop television commercial: A USGS researcher attached video cameras to four female polar bears as part of a study on how bears expend their energy. In this video cut we posted online in June 2014, you can see polar bears swim in arctic waters, tackle a dead seal meal \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and nuzzle with another bear. Combined with satellite telemetry data, behavior observations like this help scientists understand how much food and rest bears need to survive, and whether environmental change like decreased sea ice are stressing this threatened species. The ongoing research is part of the <strong>USGS Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative<\/strong>, one of many USGS research programs on wildlife populations, climate change, and land use change.

Falling Sea Stars<\/strong> Tidepool scenes of vibrantly colored sea stars like this one in San Juan Islands, Washington, could become a rare sight as the <strong>Sea Star Wasting Disease<\/strong> spreads. The disease causes sea stars to fall apart and disintegrate within days, and has been killing these sea creatures in droves from Mexico to Alaska. In November 2014, a new Cornell University study with assistance from USGS scientists finally pointed to a prime suspect in the deadly epidemic: a previously unknown virus.
