At several streamgage sites, scientists have had to extend measurement scales and rating formulas that help calculate accurate streamflow, because of record low water flows.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"205\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/09_15_2014_ine5Hts22B_09_15_2014_1\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_09_16\/increased_flow_on_control_tn.jpg\" alt=\"Increased flow over rock riffle in Sonoma Creek seen after South Napa Earthquake of August 24, 2014.\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><span class=\"small\">Increased flow over rock riffle in Sonoma Creek seen after South Napa Earthquake of August 24, 2014.
