The maps will be used by the National Weather Service to provide debris-flow warnings to the public, by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to use in conjunction with their flood-inundation maps, and by local and state emergency managers. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&quot;These maps are designed to provide emergency managers with tools to implement protective measures to preserve values at risk, including life and property,&quot; said Lee Rosenberg of the Multi-Agency Support Group (MASG) that represents federal and state agencies. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n&quot;Knowing the areas most vulnerable to a particular hazard is critical in preparing to meet the needs of that community when an emergency strikes,&quot; said Henry Renteria, Director of the Governor&#39;s Office of Emergency Services (OES).  &quot;The new maps are a brand new tool emergency managers and first responders can use in their planning and response efforts.&quot; <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMore information about debris-flow and landslide hazards can be accessed at <strong><u><a href=\"http:\/\/landslides.usgs.gov\/research\/wildfire\/07sca\/\">http:\/\/landslides.usgs.gov\/research\/wildfire\/07sca\/<\/a><\/u>. <\/strong>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1197003600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169491"},{"tid":"170469"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
