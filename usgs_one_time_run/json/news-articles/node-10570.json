During most seasons polar bears prefer mixed ice habitats near ice edges in shallow waters over the continental shelf. In past decades, polar bears could maintain this habitat preference for nearshore ice, but in recent years, extensive ice melt has forced most polar bears to summer in deepwater ice habitat more than 200 km from the mainland coast. A smaller segment of the population is forced to use shoreline habitat. Other research suggests that prey resources may be diminished for polar bears force to occupy land and the deep water pack ice during summer. For example, the winter and spring distribution of ringed seals, the most important prey for polar bears, reflects the general distribution of polar bears. During summer, while some ringed seals may track the ice edge as it retreats north, others may have an open water life style and thus would be unavailable to polar bears. Bearded seals, due to their bottom-feeding habits, have not been available to polar bears summering over deep-water habitats during recent summers. In addition, a changing sea ice environment may affect reproduction of both predator and prey. Many pregnant polar bears in Alaska den on the active sea ice, the thinning of which brings into question whether winter ice has the stability necessary for successful denning. Seals also depend on sea ice for birth and hence are also susceptible to changes in the composition of sea ice. <strong>George Durner and Steven Amstrup, Session 33, Tuesday, Sept. 26, 8:40-9:00 a.m.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Survival and population size of polar bears in western Hudson Bay in relation to earlier sea ice breakup.<\/strong> Researchers estimated survival and population size for polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in western Hudson Bay, Canada, from data collected 1984-2004, and handling data for polar bears that entered the community of Churchill, Manitoba, adjacent to the study area. The size of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population significantly declined from about 1194 in 1987 to 935 in 2004. Survival of prime-adult polar bears (age 5-19 years) was stable over the course of the study for both females and males. However, survival of juvenile, subadult, and old adult polar bears was associated with the timing of sea ice breakup, which was variable between years and occurred about two weeks earlier in 2004 than at the beginning of the study in 1984. The researchers propose that this correlation provides evidence for a causal association between earlier sea ice breakup (due to climatic warming) and decreased polar bear survival. It may also explain why Churchill, like other communities along the western coast of Hudson Bay, has experienced an increase in the number of human-polar bear interactions in recent years. Earlier sea ice breakup may have resulted in a larger number of nutritionally stressed polar bears, which are encroaching upon human habitations in search of supplemental food. Because western Hudson Bay is near the southern limit of the polar bear&acute;s range, these findings may foreshadow how more northerly polar bear populations will respond to the continued warming that is projected for many parts of the Arctic. <strong>Eric Regehr, Session 13, Sunday, Sept. 24, 1:20-1:40 p.m.<\/strong><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1159156800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169017"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
