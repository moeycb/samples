Typical motivations for land change are cultivation (e.g. slash-and-burn fields, rice paddies, modern farms); occupation (villages, cities, housing developments); and other cultural and economic pursuits (roads, schools, airports).\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/12_01_2011_bfv2YmkXXS_12_01_2011_0#.VCWFuBYXOAb\"><img src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/12_01_2011\/bfv2YmkXXS_12_01_2011\/medium\/montana_oldhouse_storm.jpg\" alt=\"Agricultural Field in the Great Plains Region of Montana\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a> An abandoned farmstead in eastern Montana stands as a symbol of land use change carried out by American and European settlers in the Great Plains. USGS photo, Terry Sohl.[\/caption]\n\nThrough time the surface of the earth has become a mosaic of natural and cultural landscapes. Each patch of the mosaic forms part of a diverse, yet interconnected set of landscapes ranging from relatively pristine natural ecosystems to completely human-dominated urban and industrial areas. \u00c2\u00a0The scale of landscape change ranges from local (conversion of a farm into a suburb) to regional (conversion of tall grass prairie ecosystems to agriculture) to global changes (changing climate conditions, sea level rise).\n\n<strong>Changes in land and climate linked<\/strong>\n\nLand change and climate change have close connections. Climate change is widely recognized as having the potential to profoundly transform both ecological (natural) and cultural (human-influenced) landscapes. At the same time, land-use changes (e.g. deforestation, large-scale agriculture) not only have important impacts on climate and weather, but they also affect biodiversity (the breadth of plant and animal species), biogeochemical cycles (e.g. ocean acidification, hypoxia), and water resources through the alteration of greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere, water vapor exchanges, water infiltration into the soil, water routing, and sediment flow.\n\nUrban development, forestry, agriculture, mining, and other land uses can substantially alter the Earth's surface. Land use changes and the resultant change in land cover have important effects on ecological systems and processes. Projecting future land-cover change allows for the optimization and mitigation of potential consequences on numerous ecosystem processes such as biodiversity, water quality, and climate.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"560\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/09_26_2014_lPGr3VUi21_09_26_2014_0#.VCWn3xYXOAZ\"><img class=\"   \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/09_26_2014\/lPGr3VUi21_09_26_2014\/large\/2010_Frederick_Co_jux_small.jpg\" alt=\"Expanding Suburbs\" width=\"560\" height=\"373\" \/><\/a> A scene at the edge of a suburban housing development and farmland in Frederick County, Maryland.

The land cover maps provide 250-meter resolution information for 17 different land-use and land-cover classes, offering an unprecedented combination of thematic detail and spatial resolution for land-cover projections<em>. \u00c2\u00a0<\/em>\n\nThe four land cover scenarios that were modeled are based, in turn, on carefully-defined environmental scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ensuring that the projected land cover maps may be used in assessment frameworks consistent with IPCC scenario characteristics.\u00c2\u00a0 The scenarios vary in terms of both climate and socioeconomic conditions in the future.\n\nThe A1B scenario is characterized by very high economic growth, strong technological innovation, and open, global economies and societies.\u00c2\u00a0 Projected land use changes include sprawling urban growth, agricultural expansion, and heavy use of forested lands for wood products.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_202461\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/landcover-modeling.cr.usgs.gov\/index_a2.php\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-202461\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/09\/wash_baltimore_big_2050.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a> A projection of developed land (red) in the Baltimore-Washington area in 2050.

The result is a seamless, consistent set of annual land-cover maps from 1938 through 2100, at 250-meter resolution and with 17 land-cover classes.\u00c2\u00a0 Completion of backcast land-cover data for the conterminous United States will occur by early 2015.\n\nThe backcast, the current, and the projected future land-cover data produced by USGS offer scientists in many fields the opportunity to study past effects of land-use change on the environment and to assess potential impacts for the future.\n\n<strong>Learn more <\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/landcover-modeling.cr.usgs.gov\/index.php\">USGS Land Cover Modeling<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/climate_landuse\/land_carbon\/pubs\/Sohl_etal_2014_LULC.pdf\">Professional paper<\/a> in <em>Ecological Applications<\/em>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/climate_landuse\/land_carbon\/default.asp\">USGS National Land Carbon Assessment<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/climate_landuse\/lcs\/\">USGS Land Change Science<\/a>\n\n&nbsp;","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24391","uid":"31","filename":"Main2.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/Main2.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"35106","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"49fb37fd-aae3-435a-b990-de85925b4cbb","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Climate Change","land carbon studies","Land Cover","Land Use","Mapping","modeling","urban growth"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1411754009","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
