High flows of about 25,000 cfs also occurred in 2008 and 2009 on the Moreau River near Whitehorse.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">A USGS South Dakota flood watch <a href=\"http:\/\/sd.water.usgs.gov\/projects\/flooding\/\">webpage<\/a> has been released to help track the current flooding conditions across the State.The website shows locations of streamgages where the water level is above flood stage or at high flow and provides flood tracking charts and tables of recent and previous flood peak flows.<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/osw\/\">Click here<\/a> for more information on USGS flood-related activities.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in selected streams and rivers across the U.S. The USGS collects data from more than 7,700 streamgages, most of which provide real-time data that is transmitted every hour. The information is routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, determination of flood risk, and for many recreational activities.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["South Dakota"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","South Dakota","flooding","streamgages","streamflow"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1300766400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169781"},{"tid":"170028"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
