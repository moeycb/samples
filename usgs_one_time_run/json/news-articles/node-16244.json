Starting in the morning, you might be at home. Your next pin might mark you on a roadway, on your way to work or school.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs we take these hourly samples of your location over the course of several days, a nice pattern will probably emerge. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see lots of locations around your home and workplace or school, because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at those places most often. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sample more locations around your favorite supermarket, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you find food; or around restaurants where you meet friends and dates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Tracey, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/sandiego\">who is based in San Diego, California<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_198921\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"905\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/USGSWERCsuperendangered_1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-198921  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/USGSWERCsuperendangered_1.jpg\" alt=\"USGSWERC\" width=\"905\" height=\"609\" \/><\/a> An example map of a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hourly movement data.

However, we would have no idea where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in between these hourly samples, so scientists have to create a \u00e2\u0080\u0098utilization distribution\u00e2\u0080\u0099 model that describes your probable home range\u00e2\u0080\u0094to estimate where you are likely to be on the landscape at any point in time.\n\nScientists can create this utilization distribution model using your movement data. The model would assign a high probability score to the area around your home since you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re frequently found there, and this high probability cell would be visualized as the darkest shade on a map (we use dark red in the figure below).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_198931\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"932\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/USGSWERCsuperendangered_2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-198931   \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/USGSWERCsuperendangered_2.jpg\" alt=\"2D\" width=\"932\" height=\"627\" \/><\/a> An example of a 2D MKDE probability map calculated using the movement data from the previous figure.

But suppose you live in a particularly rugged landscape requiring you to drive up and down a mountain for your daily commute. Or suppose you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a crop duster pilot who flies an airplane every day. Your probability cells and home range wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just span horizontally across a map\u00e2\u0080\u0094they would span vertically into the third dimension, estimating your movements winding in and out of valleys, or soaring high then diving down to reach your fields.\n\nAnd it is these 3-D probability cells that offer an intriguing tool for ecologists studying endangered species and human interactions.\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * *<\/p>\nMontane, flying, or diving species pose unique challenges for wildlife conservation programs. Like our mountain commuter and pilot examples, these species might utilize different elevations, altitudes, or depths when feeding, resting, or breeding. Management agencies in charge of designing wildlife conservation plans have a need to understand these geographic contexts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor example, giant pandas move up into higher elevations during warmer summer months to forage in different bamboo habitats, then return to the lower elevation valleys during the cold winter months. Pandas also range widely during the breeding season looking for mates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says study coauthor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandiegozooglobal.org\/icr\/james_sheppard_ph.d\">James Sheppard<\/a> of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sandiegozooglobal.org\/icr\/\">San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u009cTraditional 2-D home range estimators can underestimate the range area occupied by animals within steep terrain habitats, such as wild pandas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0101205\">In their new <em>PLOS ONE <\/em>paper<\/a>, Tracey, Sheppard, and colleagues demonstrate how to calculate three-dimensional home ranges for <a href=\"http:\/\/ecos.fws.gov\/speciesProfile\/profile\/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A0A5\">pandas<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/ecos.fws.gov\/speciesProfile\/profile\/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B002\">condors<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/ecos.fws.gov\/speciesProfile\/profile\/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A033\">dugongs<\/a>, using location data that other scientists collected via GPS transmitters attached to animals in the wild.

This 3D MKDE probability map estimates where an individual dugong is likely found at different tidal heights: red is where this dugong is likely to be at low tide, yellow is mid-tide, and dark green is high tide; brown is the shoreline. Indeed, dugongs can only reach very shallow waters during high tides, and retreat away from shore as the tide goes out.

So Tracey and colleagues turned to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdsc.edu\/\">San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)<\/a> for help.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thrilled when I learned that USGS and San Diego Zoo wanted to use SDSC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supercomputers for this important work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdsc.edu\/~sinkovit\">Robert Sinkovits<\/a>, who leads the Scientific Applications group at SDSC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur machines are used for a wide range of computational tasks, such as modeling collisions between entire galaxies, analyzing human genomes and studying interactions between proteins.

Condor habitat can intersect with human activities and infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0094<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/ecosystems\/energy_wildlife\/index.html\">including turbines at wind energy generation facilities<\/a>. Wind energy developers need tools that map out where bird species most often frequent, so they can anticipate sites with high likelihood of bird collision incidents.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you wanted to find out where condor home ranges intersect with planned turbine sites using traditional 2-D analysis, you just stack the two maps and pick out areas that overlap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Sheppard of the San Diego Zoo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut both condors and turbines occupy 3-D space: condors fly at certain altitudes, while turbines protrude into the airspace to a certain height and volume. A simple 2-D analysis can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take this into account, and might inaccurately estimate the risk of bird-turbine conflicts, depending on the geography at hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed, <a href=\"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0101205\">in their new paper<\/a>, Tracey, Sheppard, and others demonstrate just that, using data from one condor to test whether 3-D home ranges might offer more accurate estimates of bird collision risks\u00e2\u0080\u0094in this case calculating a lower collision risk estimate than 2-D methods. And researchers also hope to compare the 3-D condor information with 3-D climate models, to determine the climate conditions that induce condors to make long-distance flights that might take them near human structures.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese visualizations have never been done before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tracey. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is staggering to think about the trillions of calculations that went into it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/06_30_2014_rVMy51Coo3_06_30_2014_2#.U7RDSzC1F8F\"><img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/06_30_2014\/rVMy51Coo3_06_30_2014\/large\/USGSWERCsuperendangered_5.jpg\" alt=\"Supercomputers Map Out Super Endangered Species \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In 3-D\" width=\"960\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> Example flight data from a subadult female condor which flew through a proposed wind energy installation (A), and 3-D models of wind turbines in their proposed locations to-size, overlaid with the recorded flight path (B).
