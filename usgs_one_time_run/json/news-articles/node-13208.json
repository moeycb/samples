He will share the experiences he had during the Mauna Ulu eruption and talk about the volcanic features created by it in a 3-mile guided hike on Saturday, January 8, 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the early morning hours of May 24, 1969, a 2.5 mile-long series of fissures opened on the upper east rift zone of Kilauea. Molten lava spattered from the fissures, announcing the start of a new eruption that continued for five years, completely filled two pit craters, and formed a new lava shield, Mauna Ulu (Growing Mountain).<\/p>\r\n<p>The hike is free and open to the public, but park entrance fees apply. Hikers should wear sturdy shoes, bring drinking water and snacks, and be prepared for cool, rainy weather.<\/p>\r\n<p>Pre-registration is not required. Meet at 9:00 a.m. sharp at the Mauna Ulu parking area on the Chain of Craters Road in Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park. A map to this area is available <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/havo\/planyourvisit\/upload\/entire_park_final.pdf\">online<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hike will last about 3 hours.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>This Mauna Ulu hike is one of many programs offered by HVO in January 2011, which is Hawai`i Island's second annual Volcano Awareness Month.
