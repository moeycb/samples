Though the show takes place in the fictional seven kingdoms of Westeros, there are parts of the show that can be paralleled to Earth science today. The words, winter is coming, used frequently in this fantasy TV show, proclaim that the nine-year summer is over, and winter is literally coming. It also brings the fear of giants, mythological frightening characters and dark magic to the people of Westeros. As in Game of Thrones, our world is affected by weather and climate.<\/p><h2>Winter and Climate Change<\/h2><p>Unlike in Westeros, where nine-year summers are possible, the first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere occurs each year on December 21.

Impacts related to climate change are evident across geographic regions and in many sectors important to society\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as human health, agriculture and food security, water supply, transportation, energy, ecosystems, and others. These impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive throughout this century and beyond. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/data-for-climate-resilience\/\">White House Climate Action Plan<\/a> recognizes that even as we act to curb the carbon pollution that helps drive climate change, we must also prepare citizens and communities for the climate impacts that are already underway.

Effects of global climate change are clear in Glacier National Park, MT, where <a href=\"http:\/\/nrmsc.usgs.gov\/research\/glacier_retreat.htm\">glaciers are shrinking<\/a> and many have already disappeared. Shrinking glaciers reflect changes in temperature and precipitation. Scientists estimate there were approximately 150 glaciers in the park in1850; most of them were still present in 1910 when the park was established. In 2010, the USGS concluded there were only 25 glaciers larger than 25 acres remaining in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/glac\/index.htm\">the park<\/a>. A computer-based climate model predicts that some of the park\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest glaciers will vanish by 2030. This is only one model of prediction but, if true, then the park\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glaciers could disappear in the next several decades. However, glacier disappearance could occur even earlier, as many of the glaciers are retreating faster than their predicted rates. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-10-6\/Molnia%20-%20Fig%2023A%20-%20Muir%20-%201980.jpg\"><img alt=\"Glacier\" height=\"364\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-10-6\/Molnia%20-%20Fig%2023A%20-%20Muir%20-%201980.jpg\" title=\"Muir Glacier and Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park\" width=\"571\" \/><\/a> This ship-deck-based August 1980 photograph of Muir Glacier and Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, St. Elias Mountains, Alaska, shows the nearly 200-ft-high retreating tidewater end of Muir Glacier with part of its face capped by a few angular pinnacles of ice, called s\u00c3&copy;racs.

Ice caps <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/edu\/watercycleice.html\">influence the weather<\/a> and have a direct effect on other aspects of the water cycle. Ice is very white, of course, and since white reflects sunlight (and thus, heat), large ice fields can determine weather patterns. Air temperatures can be higher a mile above ice caps than at the surface, and wind patterns are affected by the presence or absence of ice sheets. Even though the amount of water locked up in glaciers and ice caps is a small percentage of all water on (and in) the Earth, it represents a large percentage of the world&#39;s total fresh water. Although the amount of water locked up in ice and snow is only about 1.7 percent of all water on Earth, the majority of total fresh water on Earth, about 68.7 percent, is held in ice caps and glaciers.
