Thereafter, ice thickness slightly increased but the total\r\nvolume of sea ice did not increase.<\/p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate \" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">A New Way to Model Sea Ice Thickness<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep32\/20080304_32_Sea_Ice.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | \r\n       <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ID=62\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp;\r\n  \t   <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/> or  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>Scientists\r\npropose that the volume stayed constant during the study's latter years because\r\nwhile the ice was thickening in the high latitudes of the Arctic,\r\nthe surrounding sea ice was melting. Sea ice, however, can only become so thick,\r\nand if Arctic sea ice continues to melt, the total volume of sea ice in the Arctic will decrease.<\/p>\r\n<p>The\r\nmost dramatic losses in sea ice cover have occurred since 2003, and as\r\nscientists acquire newer data, they will apply the new model to study recent\r\nyears of ice thickness and volume change.<\/p>\r\n<p>This modeling approach uses sea\r\nice motion data to follow parcels of ice backward in time at monthly intervals for\r\nup to 3 years while accumulating a history of the solar radiation and air temperature\r\nto which the ice was exposed. The model was constructed by fitting these data\r\nwith an ice parcel's known thickness to determine how the thickness of sea ice changes\r\nin response to different environmental conditions. Data on the known thickness are\r\nobtained from measurements by submarine cruises and surface coring missions.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Sea\r\nice is affected by the accumulation of environmental factors to which it has\r\nbeen exposed,\" said USGS Director Mark Myers. \"Understanding the natural\r\nvariability of sea ice thickness is critical for improving global climate\r\nmodels. Sea ice regulates energy exchange and plays\r\nan important role in the Earth's climate system.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>This model,\r\nbuilt on historical observations, complements thermodynamic models that simulate\r\nice thickness. Science benefits from having different models. Comparing\r\ndifferent model outputs can help improve predictive capabilities. Many\r\nscientists worldwide are using satellite and ground observations of the Arctic's atmosphere, ice and ocean to gain a better\r\nunderstanding of how changes at the top of the world affect ecosystems both\r\nlocally and globally.<\/p>\r\n<p>The report \"Fluctuating Arctic sea\r\nice thickness changes estimated by an in-situ learned and empirically forced\r\nneural network model\" was recently published in","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1204606800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169181"},{"tid":"169633"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
