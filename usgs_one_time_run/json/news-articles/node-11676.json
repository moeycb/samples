Closer scrutiny reveals that their generally small size makes freshwater resources susceptible to many threats. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water on many islands, and for quite a few islands, it is the only reliable source of water throughout the year. Faced with a growing demand for this valuable resource, and the potential negative effects on its availability and quality from changes in global climate, increasingly sophisticated management approaches will be needed to ensure a dependable supply of freshwater for the residents of these islands.<br \/><br \/>The newly published U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 35-page report, <a href=","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Climate Change","environment","groundwater","freshwater","Nearshore"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1241150400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169447"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
