With more than 99% of the A.T.&rsquo;s corridor on Federal or State land, it is the longest continuously marked, maintained, and publicly protected trail in the United States.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS partnered with the National Park Service and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy to incorporate the trail data onto the Maine US Topo maps.

Two of these types, the National Historic Trails and National Scenic Trails, can only be designated by Act of Congress. National scenic trails are extended trails located as to provide for maximum outdoor recreation potential and for the conservation and enjoyment of nationally significant scenic, historic, natural, and cultural qualities of the area through which such trails may pass.<br \/><br \/>There are 11 National Scenic Trails:   \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Appalachian National Scenic Trail<\/li>\r\n<li>Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail<\/li>\r\n<li>Continental Divide National","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maine"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Core Science Systems","topographic Map","Topo Maps","topographic Map","Digital Topo Maps","Maine","National Scenic Trails","Appalachian Trail"],"distribution":["Mapping"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1414382400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169911"},{"tid":"170090"},{"tid":"170049"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
