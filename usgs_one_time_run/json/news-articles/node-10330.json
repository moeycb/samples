Chewing its way through the relatively soft, unconsolidated sediments of the LA basin, the diamond-bit drill is expected to reach the 1,000-foot depth by July 23. The layers of material in the cores will yield information dating from the past few hundred years in the upper layers to more than a half-million years ago at the 1,000-foot depth. \r\n<p>Following the coring operation, sensitive instruments that can measure changes in water levels and the chemical characteristics of underground water will be installed in the drill holes and that data will be monitored by geologists, hydrologists and chemists at the USGS and hydrogeologists at the WRD. \r\n<p>Other instruments that can measure ground movements will be installed in the hole and monitored by scientists at the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). \"Being able to place instruments this deep is a real opportunity for us,\" said Dr. Jamison Steidl, a SCEC member and seismologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"Because \u00e2\u0080\u0098cultural noise&rsquo; from traffic often interferes with interpretation of seismic signals obtained from surface and near-surface instruments, having these deep- set instruments will give us a much clearer picture of seismic wave propagation. This collaboration is a great opportunity for scientists to improve our ability to record the small earthquakes so that we can better image the faults under Los Angeles, improve our modeling of them and perfect our techniques for","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"932356800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
