These contaminants are mostly derived from the natural geologic materials that make up the aquifers from which well water is drawn. Complete findings are available <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nawqa\/studies\/domestic_wells\/\">online<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Nitrate was the most common inorganic contaminant derived from man-made sources-such as from fertilizer applications and septic-tanks-that was found at concentrations greater than the Federal drinking-water standard for public-water supplies (10 parts per million).&nbsp; Nitrate was greater than the standard in about 4 percent of sampled wells.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The study shows that the occurrence of selected contaminants varies across the country, often following distinct geographic patterns related to geology, geochemical conditions, and land use. For example, elevated concentrations of nitrate were largely associated with intensively farmed land, such as in parts of the Midwest Corn Belt and the Central Valley of California. Radon was found at relatively high concentrations in crystalline-rock aquifers in the Northeast, in the central and southern Appalachians, and in central Colorado.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The results of this study are important because they show that a large number of people may be unknowingly affected,\" said Matt Larsen, USGS Associate Director for Water. \"Greater attention to the quality of drinking water from private wells and continued public education are important steps toward the goal of protecting public health.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS sampled private wells from 1991 to 2004 in 30 of the Nation's principal aquifers used for water supply. As many as 219 properties and contaminants, including pH, major ions, nutrients, radionuclides, trace elements, pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and microbial contaminants, were measured. Sampled water was taken from private wells before any home treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Other contaminants found in the private wells were man-made organics, including herbicides, insecticides, solvents, disinfection b","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Water Quality","drinkingwater","water","water","wells","publichealth"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1238126400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169633"},{"tid":"169944"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
