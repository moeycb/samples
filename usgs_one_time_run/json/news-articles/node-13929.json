The USGS, at the request of the U.S. Congress, has published reports on water-level changes in the High Plains Aquifer since 1988. Congress requested these reports in response&nbsp;to&nbsp;substantial water-level declines&nbsp;in&nbsp;large areas of&nbsp;the aquifer.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This multi-state, groundwater-level monitoring program has allowed water-level changes in all eight states to be tracked over time and has provided data critical to evaluating different options for groundwater management. This level of coordinated groundwater-level monitoring is unique among major, multi-state regional&nbsp;aquifers in the country.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The report \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2012\/5291\/\">Water-Level and Storage Changes in the High Plains Aquifer, Predevelopment to 2011 and 2009&ndash;11<\/a>\" is available online.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Wyoming","Colorado","Kansas","New Mexico","Oklahoma","Texas","Nebraska","South Dakota"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Water Groundwater Resources","Geographic Areas South Central","Geographic Areas Rocky Mountain"],"distribution":["Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1361509200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170278"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
