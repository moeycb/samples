Also, biologists saw newly hatched larval fish and evidence that the fish were spawning.<\/p>\r\n<p>The violent oscillations, though, washed away algae that are essential to the food web of the critically endangered fish, though biologists hope they will grow back quickly. Biologists with the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nevada Department of Wildlife will carefully monitor Devils Hole for any harmful after-effects to the fish.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ambre and fellow USGS researcher Olin Feuerbacher happened to be conducting Devils Hole pupfish behavior surveys on April 4, the day the earthquake struck. They caught the earthquake-induced wave action on video cameras they had just reconnected to their recording position inside the pool 10 minutes before the quake struck.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The fish begin to move out of the camera&rsquo;s view as the waves start getting bigger, and then, because of all the sediment being stirred up, you can&rsquo;t see the fish. As the waves grew stronger, the fish likely moved into deeper waters,&rdquo; she said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Paul Barrett, a FWS biologist who leads the Devils Hole Pupfish Recovery Team, said that water-quantity and -quality changes after an earthquake can affect sensitive aquatic environments by changing water levels or by reducing the amount of algae or invertebrates that live on the ledge. But sometimes they can be beneficial as well.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Earthquakes, such as a 1978 temblor in Mexico, can set up waves that clear the spawning shelf of the algae upon which the pupfish rely, however depending upon the time of year, the algae may regenerate quite rapidly,&rdquo; said Barrett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Furthermore, quakes can serve a useful purpose in shaking silt and other fine particles that have washed into Devils Hole off of the spawning shelf and into the deeper waters.&nbsp; This frees important space between the substrate particles where the Devils Hole pupfish larvae seek refuge.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, said Barrett, after the April 4 Mexicali quake, the National Park Service recorded a slight increase in larval abundance as compared to a similar survey a few weeks before the earthquake occurred.<\/p>\r\n<p>The phenomenon of earthquakes and corresponding seismic effects on water wells, streams, springs, seeps and lakes is well known.
