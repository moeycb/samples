These data are used to forecast whether a beach is unsafe for swimmers. Beaches are subject to high bacteria levels following storms.<\/p>\r\n<p>Heavy rains from Ike significantly impacted northwestern Indiana and Chicago because the ground was already saturated by a stalled cold front.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-9-30\/hurricane_ike_lmichigan1.jpg\" alt=\"Real Time Data\" width=\"280\" height=\"208\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-9-30\/hurricane_ike_lmichigan2.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Michigan shore\" width=\"280\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Illinois","Indiana","Michigan","Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Hurricane Ike","Lake Michigan","beachcontamination"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1222747200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170321"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
