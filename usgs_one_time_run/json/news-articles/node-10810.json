The satellite was temporarily taken out of service\r\nin October 2007 following a cell failure within one of the satellite's two\r\noperating on-board batteries.<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS Flight Operations Team engineers were forced to discover ways to\r\nbalance the energy demand of Landsat 5's operational and imaging\r\ninstrumentation with the satellite's slightly diminished energy storage\r\ncapacity. The Team's solution was to reconfigure and align Landsat 5's image\r\nacquisition schedule and to rely more on direct power from its solar array.\r\nAdditionally, schedule changes were made to limit imaging during the winter\r\nmonths and to resume all routine imaging over the continental U.S. from March\r\nthrough September. Some concessions will also be made to limit imaging over\r\ninternational sites.<\/p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate \" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">Taking the Long View From Space<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep20\/20071130_20_landremote_sensing.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | \r\n       <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ID=50\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp;\r\n  \t   <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/> or  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>Restoration of Landsat 5's image data collection and data transfer\r\ncapability is considered essential by many federal, state and local government\r\nand civilian land and resource agency managers in managing response to\r\nwildfires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters. Since\r\nits launch on March 1, 1984, Landsat 5 has provided more than 600,000\r\nindividual images, recording clear-cutting and recovery conditions of rain\r\nforests, near- and long-term effects of the Chernobyl explosion,\r\nbefore-and-after records of Hurricane Katrina's impact, as well as more subtle\r\nnatural and human-induced changes to the global land surface. In addition to\r\nthese emergency and management applications of Landsat imagery, millions of\r\npeople each day use web based mapping products supported by this and other\r\nimagery data to get where they want to go.<\/p>\r\n<p>While the design life of Landsat 5 was only 3 years, this remarkable\r\nsatellite is likely to produce imagery for a few more years. Landsat 7,\r\nlaunched in 1999, continues to provide the global science community with\r\nworldwide seasonal images, however, it too is operating in a slightly\r\ndiminished capacity.<\/p>\r\n<p>In an effort to ensure the continuation and improvement of global and\r\nNational land imaging products and services to its users beyond the life of\r\nLandsat 5 and Landsat 7, the President recently announced a new budget\r\ninitiative to create the National Land Imaging Program (NLIP) in the Department\r\nof the Interior.<\/p>\r\n<p>NLIP planning is underway and will be designed to ensure the continuing\r\noperational and research needs for moderate resolution and multispectral land\r\nimaging products and services are met and provided to federal and civ","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1204261200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170388"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
