The study provides evidence that will be potentially useful for policy makers,&rdquo; said Bob Joseph, Director of the USGS  Texas Water  Science Center.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the past, several factors have been thought to affect PAH concentrations in house dust, including tobacco smoking and frequency of vacuuming.&nbsp; Researchers have had little success, however, demonstrating a relation between any of those factors and PAH concentrations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sealcoat products are widely used in the U.S., both commercially and by homeowners on their driveways. The products are commonly applied to parking lots of commercial businesses (including strip malls and shopping centers); apartment and condominium complexes; churches, schools, and business parks; residential driveways; and playgrounds.
