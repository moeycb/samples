New Mexico State Engineer Scott Verhines and USGS Acting Director Suzette Kimball will join a number of federal, state and local officials at a ceremony to recognize the device that set the foundation for modern water management.<\/p>\n<p>Reporting river flows is a matter of public safety, environmental protection, and wise economic development.<strong> <\/strong>&nbsp;USGS streamgage data is used to forecast floods and droughts, manage flood flows, deliver water supplies, establish water rights, and protect threatened aquatic habitats.
