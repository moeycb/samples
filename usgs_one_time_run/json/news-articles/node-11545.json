The findings are published in this week's issue of <span class=\"italics\">Science<\/span><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The probable cause of these bat deaths has puzzled researchers and resource managers urgently trying to understand why the bats were dying in such unprecedented numbers. Since the winter of 2006-07, bat declines at many surveyed hibernation caves exceeded 75 percent.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fungus&mdash;a white, powdery-looking organism&mdash;is commonly found on the muzzles, ears and wings of afflicted dead and dying bats, though researchers have not yet determined that it is the only factor causing bats to die. Most of the bats are also emaciated, and some of them leave their hibernacula&mdash;winter caves where they hibernate&mdash;to seek food that they will not find in winter.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"250\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">What's Killing the Bats in the Northeast?<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absMiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/ep46\/20080527_46_WhiteNoseSyndrome.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=46\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp; <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/>or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\nUSGS microbiologist and lead author David Blehert isolated the fungus in April 2008, and identified it as a member of the group <em>Geomyces<\/em>.

Although the new fungus is a close genetic relative of known <span class=\"italics\">Geomyces<\/span>, it does not look like a typical member of this group under the microscope. \"We found that this fungus had colonized the skin of 90 percent of the bats we analyzed from all the states affected by white-nose syndrome,\" Blehert said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Researchers don't know yet if white-nose syndrome emerged because this newly identified fungus was introduced into caves or whether the fungus already existed in caves and began infecting bats after they were already weakened from some other cause. \"This fungus may have been recently introduced to bat hibernation caves and, if so, human and animal movements among these caves are causes that need to be considered,\"says Blehert. \"Data show the occurrence of white-nose syndrome radiating outward from the site of its first appearance, and genetic identity among fungal isolates from distant caves argues for a recent introduction of this microbe. Before the identification of white-nose syndrome, mass mortality events in bats as a result of disease were very rare.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>WNS was first seen in New York during the winter of 2006.
