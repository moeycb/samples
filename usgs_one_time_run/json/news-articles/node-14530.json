These findings indicate a previously unknown reservoir for AIv and a potential source of infection for millions of wintering birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The unexpected finding that these viruses can survive the relatively warm conditions of California wetlands in summer demonstrates the importance scientists place in rigorous testing of theories and hypotheses against real-world observations,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"It is critical that we learn as much as possible about the potential disease reservoirs and transmission pathways of avian influenza before it ever becomes a serious threat to wildlife.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The researchers found low pathogenic (LP) AIv in water and waterfowl fecal samples collected in the California Central Valley during summer, indicating on-going infections in resident waterfowl, persistent shedding and active transmission of AIv. Despite previous research suggesting that colder temperatures and increased bird densities as waterfowl congregate during migration are most favorable to the survival of these viruses, the recent findings suggest that high summer water temperatures do not prevent its circulation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Our study shows surprising complexity in the transmission of avian influenza viruses in wild birds and provides new insights on how these viruses are maintained in wild birds throughout the year,\" said Viviane H&eacute;naux, Ph.D., a scientist with the University of Wisconsin &ndash;Madison and lead author of the study.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIv) H5N1 has not been detected in North America, but has caused mortality in poultry and wild birds in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Monitoring the dynamics and potential spread of HPAI viruses in wild bird populations is difficult because outbreaks are rare and typically characterized by sudden die-offs.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Research on low pathogenic avian influenza virus dynamics can provide a model system for understanding HPAIv transmission and risks, predicting the spread of pathogenic viruses and enhancing HPAIv surveillance strategies. Most strains of avian influenza are not highly pathogenic and do not cause clinical signs in infected wild birds. Researchers often study low pathogenic forms of the virus instead because low pathogenic strains can mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza strains that cause contagious, severe illness and often death in poultry and sometimes wild birds.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the right environment the virus can also mutate into a highly pathogenic virus, with the potential to cause severe illness and death in poultry and people. Consequently, further monitoring and research on AIv in wild birds that circulates in southern wetlands can help determine the geographic distribution of these viruses, clarify the importance of summer LPAIv transmission, and evaluate the risks of transmission to domestic animals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS is the scientific arm of the Department of the Inter","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Iv","Avian Influenza","biology","California","ecosystems","National Wildlife Health Center","Wildlife Disease","birds","waterfowl","wetlands"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1329800400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169396"},{"tid":"170026"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
