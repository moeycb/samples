Although the three main rivers entering the Bay (Susquehanna, Potomac, and James) rose under the influence of Hurricane Floyd, inflows were far below record levels because of the localized pattern of rainfall during the storm [see map at <a href=\"http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/floods\/floyd\/rain_noaa.gif\">http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/floods\/floyd\/rain_noaa.gif<\/a>]. However, several rivers on the Delmarva Peninsula, where most of the rain from Floyd fell, were near or broke flow records. Therefore, effects of increased nutrient and sediment loads and changes in salinity on Bay resources are probably most significant in the tidal reaches of Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore rivers. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>In September, the average daily flow rate at the gage at the Potomac River at Little Falls was about 3.7 billion gallons per day (bgd), about 192 percent of the long-term average September flow rate (1.9 bgd). The lowest flow rate for the month was about 1.3 bgd on Sept.3, and the high was about 9.6 bgd on Sept. 10. The high did not result from rains from Hurricane Floyd, which were strongly localized. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Diversions of Potomac River water for municipal use averaged about 376 mgd in September, about 20 percent less than September of 1998, and about 6 percent less than September of 1997. Contents of the Baltimore reservoir system increased to 57,730 million gallons near the end of September, which was 79 percent of average, 73 percent of the amount available in September 1998, and 90 percent of the amount available in September 1997.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Delaware","Maryland"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"939268800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169407"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
