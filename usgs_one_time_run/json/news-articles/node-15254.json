{"title":"What's the Deal with 3DEP?","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>The USGS, along with other federal, state, local and private agencies is establishing a new 3D Elevation Program (<a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/3DEP\/\">3DEP<\/a>) designed to respond to the growing needs for three-dimensional mapping data of the United States. This coordinated partnership can help meet the country&rsquo;s needs for high-quality, 3D elevation data.<\/p>\n<p>Current and accurate 3D elevation data are essential to help communities cope with natural hazards and disasters such as floods and landslides, support infrastructure, ensure agricultural success, strengthen environmental decision-making and bolster national security.<\/p>\r\n<p>The primary goal of the 3DEP partnership is to systematically collect 3D elevation data across the Nation, using<a href=\"https:\/\/lta.cr.usgs.gov\/LIDAR\"> lidar<\/a>, a remote sensing detection system that works on the principle of radar, but uses light from a laser.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited about working with partners to apply the game-changing technology of lidar to benefit many critical needs of national importance,&rdquo; said Kevin Gallagher, USGS Associate Director of Core Science Systems. &ldquo;For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/\">FEMA<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/\">NOAA<\/a> are some of our strongest partners because they rely on this type of data to significantly improve floodplain mapping and to better communicate flood risks to communities and citizens.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The 3DEP initiative is based on the results of the<a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/3DEP\/neea.html\"> National Enhanced Elevation Assessment<\/a> that documented more than 600 business and science uses across 34 Federal agencies, all 50 States, selected local government and Tribal offices, and private and nonprofit organizations. &nbsp;The assessment also shows that 3DEP would provide more than<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2012\/3089\/\"> $690 million annually<\/a> in new benefits to government entities, the private sector, and citizens.<\/p>\r\n<p>A recent<a href=\"http:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/the-press-office\/2014\/07\/16\/fact-sheet-taking-action-support-state-local-and-tribal-leaders-they-pre\"> White House fact sheet<\/a> described how accessibility of accurate, high-quality 3D elevation data provides the foundation to the Administration&rsquo;s overall plan to assist populations in the areas of flood risk management, water resource planning, mitigation of coastal erosion and storm surge impacts, and identification of landslide hazards.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS will host a briefing on Capitol Hill on July 25 to further describe the importance, benefits and growing needs for 3D elevation data.<\/p>\r\n<p>More information about 3DEP and state specific fact sheets is <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/3DEP\/\">available online<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"556\" align=\"center\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2014_07_17\/lidar.jpg\" alt=\"A comparison of an air photo and a lidar image of an area along Secondary Road and Camp Creek, 12 miles north of John Day, OR.
