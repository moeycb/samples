{"title":"TROPICAL STORM OPAL NOT MUCH HELP &mdash; DROUGHT AFFECTS GROUND WATER IN NORTHEASTERN U.S.","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Rains from tropical storm Opal are expected to have little significant impact on long-term drought conditions in the eastern U.S., particularly ground-water levels, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \n<p>Ground-water levels are below normal from Virginia to Maine, with many wells at or near record-low levels. \r\n<p>\"Despite the rains from Opal, we are clearly in the midst of a hydrologic drought,\" said Gordon Eaton, USGS Director. \"Not only are ground-water levels low, but streamflows and key reservoirs in the East are low as well. \r\n<p>\"During a drought, the USGS supplies critical water data to help water managers better manage local water resources that are limited by low-flow conditions,\" Eaton said. \"Flow in the Delaware River system that supplies New York City and monitoring the salt front in the Hudson River are just a few of many mutual concerns.\" \r\n<p>A hydrologic drought occurs when the natural water system that we depend on -- the rivers, streams, and ground-water levels in wells -- are adversely affected by a lack of long-term moisture. The impact can be severe, and can take many months, or even years, of normal precipitation to reverse. \r\n<p>Throughout New England, ground-water levels are below normal; in most places they have been in a steady decline since early August. At several wells in Maine, new record lows have been measured. \r\n<p>In New Hampshire, the water level in a USGS ground-water observation well near Concord is 44.6 feet below the land surface, or, 3.5 feet below the long-term average level for September. \r\n<p>In New York, at a well about 20 miles south of Albany, the water level is 12.9 feet below the land surface, or, 4 feet below the long-term average for September. \r\n<p>In Maryland, at a well in Montgomery County, near Washington, D.C., the water level is 15.9 feet below the land surface, or, 2.3 feet below the long-term average for September. \r\n<p>In Virginia, at a well in Buckingham County (south of Charlottesville), the water level is 25.7 feet below the land surface, or, nearly four feet below the long-term average level for September. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"812952000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170308"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
