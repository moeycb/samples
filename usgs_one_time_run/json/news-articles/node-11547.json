It's based on a scenario that the USGS created along with emergency responders, power, water and transportation departments, social scientists, engineers and many others.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We wanted to understand not just what this would physically do, but what this would do to our society,\" said Dr. Jones. \"By putting that picture together, we've created something that's a lot more useful because it matters to people.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In the scenario, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurs on the southern San Andreas Fault, striking much of Southern California. This is roughly the same magnitude as earthquakes that struck California in 1857 and 1906,\"<\/p>\r\n<p>\"A big San Andreas earthquake is inevitable, and it's something every Southern Californian should be ready for,\" said Dr. Jones.<\/p>\r\n<p>The earthquake in this scenario would lead to 1,800 deaths and more than $200 billion in losses.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ShakeOut is a great science application and tool for decision makers, but it's also a chance for the public to make a difference.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"You have an individual responsibility for your own earthquake safety, but you're also part of a bigger community,\" said Jones. \"What each of us do or don't do to prepare for a big earthquake affects what all of our lives will be like after one, so do your part.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>You can check out the interview in episode 70 of CoreCast at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=70\">www.usgs.gov\/corecast<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nearly five million people have already signed up to take part in the ShakeOut.
