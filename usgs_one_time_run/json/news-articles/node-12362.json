The USGS is among many agencies taking part, in line with its mission of providing data from a range of scientific disciplines to help understand the earth, manage its resources and detect and minimize its hazards. The festival culminates in a daylong event at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"I like to think that there is a lot of scientist in some of us, but at least a little scientist in all of us,\" said Dr. Marcia McNutt, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. \"For anyone who has ever wondered about the natural world, why things are the way they are, or wanted to get hands-on with nature, here is your chance!\"<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS events in conjunction with the Science Festival include:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Sat.

Rare video and an open Q&amp;A follow with biologists Roger Hothem, Peter Coates, and Brianne Brussee.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Tourists visiting Alcatraz see the famous prison right away, but in the spring and early summer, there are actually hundreds of birds nesting around the island, and hundreds more with nests hidden away in the trees, bushes and rock debris on the island,\" Coates said. \"We want to give kids and the public a peek at the hidden lives of these birds, and also give them a glimpse of what a biologist&rsquo;s life is like.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Seating for this event is limited to 100 guests.
