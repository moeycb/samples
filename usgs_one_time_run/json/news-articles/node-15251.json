This map provides a framework for continued scientific investigation of Mars as the long-range target for human space exploration.<\/p>\r\n<p>The new map brings together observations and scientific findings from four orbiting spacecraft that have been acquiring data for more than 16 years. The result is an updated understanding of the geologic history of the surface of Mars &ndash; the solar system&rsquo;s most Earth-like planet and the only other one in our Sun&rsquo;s &ldquo;habitable zone.&rdquo; The new geologic map of Mars is available for download <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sim\/3292\/\">online<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>For hundreds of years, geologic maps have helped drive scientific thought. This new global geologic map of Mars, as well as the recent global geologic maps of Jupiter&rsquo;s moons <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sim\/3237\/\">Ganymede<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sim\/3168\/\">Io<\/a>, also illustrates the overall importance of geologic mapping as an essential tool for the exploration of the solar system.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Spacecraft exploration of Mars over the past couple decades has greatly improved our understanding of what geologic materials, events and processes shaped its surface,\" said USGS scientist and lead author, Dr. Kenneth Tanaka. &ldquo;The new geologic map brings this research together into a holistic context that helps to illuminate key relationships in space and time, providing information to generate and test new hypotheses.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS-led mapping effort reveals that the Martian surface is generally older than previously thought. Three times as much surface area dates to the first major geologic time period - the Early Noachian Epoch - than was previously mapped. This timeframe is the earliest part of the Noachian Period, which ranges from about 4.1 to about 3.7 billion years ago, and was characterized by high rates of meteorite impacts, widespread erosion of the Martian surface and the likely presence of abundant surface water.<\/p>\r\n<p>The map also confirms previous work that suggests Mars had been geologically active until the present day. There is evidence that major changes in Mars&rsquo; global climate supported the temporary presence of surface water and near-surface groundwater and ice. These changes were likely responsible for many of the major shifts in the environments where Martian rocks were formed and subsequently eroded. This new map will serve as a key reference for the origin, age and historic change of geological materials anywhere on Mars.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Findings from the map will enable researchers to evaluate potential landing sites for future Mars missions that may contribute to further understanding of the planet&rs","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["astrogeology","Mars","planetary","Planetary Science","Planetary Data","","geology","geophysics","space"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1405310400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169606"},{"tid":"169526"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
