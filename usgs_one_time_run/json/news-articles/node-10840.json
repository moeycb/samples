The new statewide probabilities are the result of a model that comprehensively combines information from seismology, earthquake geology, and geodesy (measuring precise locations on the Earth's surface).&nbsp; For the first time, probabilities for California having a large earthquake in the next 30 years can be forecast statewide.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"This new, comprehensive forecast advances our understanding of earthquakes and pulls together existing research with new techniques and data,\" explained USGS geophysicist and lead scientist Ned Field. \"Planners, decision makers and California residents can use this information to improve public safety and mitigate damage before the next destructive earthquake occurs.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><img style=\"margin: 3px; float: right;\" src=\"http:\/\/usgs.gov\/images\/logos\/cgs.jpg\" alt=\"CGS logo\" width=\"111\" height=\"143\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>The new information is being provided to decision makers who establish local building codes, earthquake insurance rates, and emergency planning and will assist in more accurate planning for inevitable future large earthquakes.<\/p>\r\n<p>The official earthquake forecasts, known as the \"Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF),\" were developed by a multidisciplinary group of scientists and engineers, known as the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities.
