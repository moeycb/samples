But CO2 source and sink estimates do not balance with the known atmospheric concentrations. Join U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientist Eric Sundquist as he discusses one of the biggest questions in global carbon cycle science today: where, why, and how big is the \"missing\" CO2 sink in the Northern Hemisphere.<!--introend--> <\/p>\r\n<p>The Fall AGU tutorials are being presented by leading scientists and are based on the meeting&rsquo;s themes.
