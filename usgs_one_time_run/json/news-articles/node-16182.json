They are conducting the \"drop, cover and hold on\" safety procedure.[\/caption]\n\nIn 2012, nearly 20 million people participated in ShakeOut drills worldwide. This year is your opportunity to show the world that you too know how to prevent a major earthquake from becoming a catastrophe by <a href=\"http:\/\/shakeout.org\/register\/\">registering here<\/a>.\n\nThe ShakeOut began in California in 2008 and has since spread to other states and regions. The first Central U.S. ShakeOut was held in 2011, and the first SouthEast ShakeOut in 2012. This year 43 states and U.S. territories, and several other countries, are officially involved. People and organizations in all other states and countries can also register their drills through the ShakeOut site.\n\nThough not all of us live in areas where there is significant earthquake risk, earthquakes are hazardous worldwide, and it is important that we all are prepared if we travel to an earthquake territory. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it your fault that you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared for activity at the <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/learn\/glossary\/?termID=67&amp;alpha=F\">fault<\/a>.\n\n<strong>Sign Up Now to ShakeOut on Oct. 17<\/strong>\n\nThough ShakeOut is just a few days away, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too late to <a href=\"http:\/\/shakeout.org\/register\/\">SIGN UP<\/a>.\n\nEarthquake hazards are a serious issue and while this drill is an important step to preparedness, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also an opportunity to be creative and make safety fun. Everyone is encouraged to join. So get in the spirit, shake it like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real, and do your part for earthquake safety.\n\nThere are many ways to participate in ShakeOut, and various <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/howtoparticipate\/\">resources and tips provided online<\/a>, including flyers, podcasts, safety manuals, and more.\n\n<strong>What To Do During the Drill<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_175156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Graphic-Drop-Cover-and-Hold-On.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-175156\" title=\"Graphic - Drop Cover and Hold On\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Graphic-Drop-Cover-and-Hold-On-300x100.jpg\" alt=\"During an earthquake, the recommended safety action is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrop, cover, and hold on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" \/><\/a> During an earthquake, the recommended safety action is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrop, cover, and hold on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d[\/caption]\n\nThe ShakeOut drill begins at 10:17AM local time. If you are indoors, you should \u00e2\u0080\u009c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/dropcoverholdon\/\">Drop, Cover, and Hold On<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it securely. If you are not near a desk or table, drop to the floor against and interior wall, then protect your head and neck with your arms. Avoid exterior walls, windows, hanging objects, mirrors, tall furniture, large appliances, and kitchen cabinets filled with heavy objects or glass.\n\nWhile on the ground, look around and see what objects could fall during a potential earthquake, and make sure to secure or move those items after the drill.\n\nIf you happen to be outdoors, move to a clear and open area if you can do so. Avoid power lines, trees, signs, buildings, vehicles, and other items that can fall on you. If you are driving, pull over to the side of the road and set the parking brake. Do not stop under bridges, overpasses, power lines, or traffic signs. Make sure to remain inside the vehicle until the shaking has stopped.\n\n<strong>USGS Science in ShakeOut<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"250\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/10_02_2012_eIYl15Nbb7_10_02_2012_1\"><img title=\"ShakeOut\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/10_02_2012\/eIYl15Nbb7_10_02_2012\/medium\/Drop_Cover_Hold_On_2.JPG\" alt=\"ShakeOut\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" \/><\/a> Children participating in an earthquake drill on April 23, 2009, at the British School in Tokyo, Showa Campus. The drill is based on the Japanese Earthquake Early Warning System.[\/caption]\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> is a proud founder and supporter of ShakeOut.\n\nThe USGS has created and <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/prepare\/\">provides valuable information<\/a> for earthquake loss and damage reduction, including hazard assessments, earthquake scenarios, real-time earthquake monitoring and updates, and public preparedness handbooks. USGS science has provided <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1324\/\">earthquake scenarios<\/a> that have shaped preparedness exercises such as ShakeOut. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/natural_hazards\/\">USGS hazards research<\/a> helps emergency managers and other leaders understand where earthquakes occur and how to mitigate potential damages and losses.\n\nThe original ShakeOut was based on a comprehensive analysis of a major earthquake in southern California known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ShakeOut Scenario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That project was completed in 2008 and led by the USGS with many partners as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/scenario\/\">demonstration<\/a> of how science can be applied to reduce risks related to natural hazards. The concept and organization of a public drill came out of the collaboration between the USGS, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scec.org\/\">Southern California Earthquake Center<\/a> (SCEC), and other partners through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthquakecountry.info\/\">Earthquake Country Alliance<\/a>. SCEC is a research consortium funded in part by the USGS. ECA is a public-private partnership of people, organizations, and regional alliances that are led by SCEC and work together to improve preparedness, mitigation, and resiliency by supporting and coordinating efforts that improve earthquake and tsunami resilience.\n\nThe success of the 2008 ShakeOut spurred the organizers at ECA to take the concept worldwide, and turn it into an annual day of disaster preparedness activities. Nationwide, ShakeOut activities are now coordinated and supported by many agencies and partners including SCEC, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/\">Federal Emergency Management Agency<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsf.gov\/\">National Science Foundation<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cusec.org\/\">Central United States Earthquake Consortium<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redcross.org\/\">American Red Cross<\/a>, and others.\n\nUSGS employees and centers across the nation are signing up to participate in the ShakeOut drill, to raise company awareness, and to provide opportunities to test occupant emergency plans.\n\nThe USGS provides rapid alerts of potential impacts from an earthquake through its <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/pager\/\">Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/pager\/\"> (PAGER)<\/a> system.
