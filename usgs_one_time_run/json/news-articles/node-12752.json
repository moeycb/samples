The current level of natural gas development in much of the country, and its effects on the landscape, is an important contemporary land-use\/land-cover issue.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>\"Large-scale landscape disturbance can have a significant impact on ecological resources and the services they provide. &nbsp;This study provides a quantitative look at the levels of disturbance, forest loss and other changes to land use and land cover,\" said Terry Slonecker, lead author of the research.<\/p>\r\n<p>Data from this report will be used to assess the effects of disturbance and land-cover change on wildlife, water quality, invasive species and socioeconomic impacts, among other investigations. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>The study found that in Greene County, 663 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 775 hectares of disturbance, including 241 kilometers (149 miles) of new roads and 126 kilometers (78 miles) of new pipelines.&nbsp; Disturbance in Greene County occurs mostly at the eastern side of the county with some activity at the north and south, and minor activity at the west of the county. <br \/><br \/>In Tioga County, 151 natural gas extraction sites resulted in more than 362 hectares of disturbance, including 46 kilometers (28 miles) of new roads and 78 kilometers (48 miles) of new pipelines.&nbsp; Disturbance in Tioga County is concentrated in the eastern half and through the central part of the county, almost in a linear fashion, in an east-west direction. <br \/><br \/>The study, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.er.usgs.gov\/publication\/ofr20121220\">Landscape Consequences","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Pennsylvania"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Climateand Land Use Change Pennsylvania Energyand Mineralsand Environmental Health Energy Resources","Geographic Areas Northeast"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1353387600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169472"},{"tid":"170559"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
