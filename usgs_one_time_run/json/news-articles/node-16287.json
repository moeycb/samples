The map provides new targets for continued scientific investigation of past potentially habitable environments on Mars. The new geologic and structural map uses the highest-resolution, orbiter-based images currently available for Mars \u00e2\u0080\u0093 data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to illuminate past geological processes in a portion of Valles Marineris. The area analyzed, called western Candor Chasma, is one of the largest canyons in the Valles Marineris canyon system. The resulting map provides the most detailed information of the geology of Mars at a human scale over a broad area of terrain, and is available for download <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sim\/3309\/\">online.<\/a> &quot;One can see this map as a preview of the kind of geology humans will conduct when we eventually land on Mars,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laszlo Kestay, USGS Astrogeology Science Center Director. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis also demonstrates how the very high resolution topographic and image data we can obtain from Mars\u00e2\u0080\u0099 orbit enables scientific studies on par with rovers and other spacecraft that land on Mars.&quot; <strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Map Answers Questions on How the Grand Canyon of Mars Formed<\/strong> The Mariner 9 spacecraft first observed sedimentary rock formations in the canyons of Valles Marineris in 1971, and this new map addresses the outstanding question about the rocks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 environment of formation, or depositional conditions. Previous scientific hypotheses regarding depositional conditions in Candor Chasma include sediment accumulation in lakebeds, volcanic eruptions under glaciers within the canyons and accumulation of wind-blown sand and dust. The HiRISE images show for the first time detailed structures within these rocks that reveal their origin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis new map shows that at the time these sediments were deposited, a part of west Candor Chasma, specifically Candor Colles, contained numerous shallow, spring-fed lakes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS scientist and map author, Dr. Chris Okubo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese lakes helped to trap wind-blown sand and dust, which accumulated over time and formed the extensive sedimentary deposits we see today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These depositional conditions are similar to playa lakes in the American west, such as in Death Valley, California.

The shaking caused the sediments to liquefy and formed features called injectite megapipes, which are now a series of low hills throughout the map area. These low hills are called the Candor Colles, after which the new geologic map is named. <strong>A Place Ripe for Exploring<\/strong> \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis map of the Candor Colles region will open up a new view of soft-sediment deformation in sedimentary deposits on Mars \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a place that is ripe for exploring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Marjorie Chan, geology professor at the University of Utah. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInjectite pipes are observed in analogous sedimentary systems on Earth, such as the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone and Carmel Formation, but on Mars they might be an order of magnitude larger than most terrestrial examples.
