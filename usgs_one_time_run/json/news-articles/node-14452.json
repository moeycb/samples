Results of these partnerships will help guide management of connectivity throughout the transboundary region of British Columbia and Washington State, an important area for wildlife that faces numerous technical and political challenges to connectivity management.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>A forest management project that will help land managers strategically maximize snow retention by protecting forests in some areas while opening gaps in others. Scientists will map climate-forest-snow interactions across the Pacific Northwest, predicting how forest change is likely to affect the timing of snow melt in different locations, and testing those predictions against field and citizen-science observations. These findings will allow decision makers to link climate-forest-snow interactions to ecohydrologic conditions important to management and, ultimately, to provide more water later in the season for hydropower, agriculture and fish flows.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>A project to support climate resilience planning for the 15 Columbia River Basin Tribes and the three Inter-Tribal Organizations. This project will help tribes assess their needs and policy and technical capacity to address climate change. The abundance of culturally significant foods, such as salmon, deer, root plants and berries are guaranteed by treaty with the federal government, and are vital to the cultural existence and economic vitality of these communities.
