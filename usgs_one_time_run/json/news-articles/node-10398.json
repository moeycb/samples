This information has proved to be invaluable to the Honduran government in the initial recovery phases and will serve as a foundation for rebuilding disaster resilient communities that are to the greatest extent possible located out of harm&rsquo;s way for future natural disasters. \r\n<p>Daily updates about the teams visits to Honduras can be found on the Internet at <a href=\"http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/events\/mitch\/USGSteam\/index.html\">http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/events\/mitch\/USGSteam\/index.html<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"916117200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169811"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
