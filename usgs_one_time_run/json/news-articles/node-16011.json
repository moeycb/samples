The series of images collected by these satellites has provided a vital worldwide reference for researchers and resource managers.\n\nFor example, comparing Landsat images taken on earlier dates with those on later dates can help to monitor\n<ul>\n\t<li>forests under threat from illegal logging, deforestation, and biofuel production;<\/li>\n\t<li>water resources crucial for cities and agriculture and key to public health and national economies; and<\/li>\n\t<li>agricultural production in connection with changing conditions of land and climate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nBy combining the nearly 40-year global Landsat record with other Earth-observation systems and the latest scientific techniques in Earth imaging, researchers around the globe can not only see and describe present conditions, they can also track how those conditions have changed over time and outline the future of many natural resources with increasing accuracy.\n<h3><strong>Impartial information freely available<\/strong><\/h3>\nSystematic observation of the land from space provides objective data that we can trust \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fundamental information on a national and global scale that is direct and impartial. And as the demands for limited resources grow, having impartial data on how precious resources are changing over time will become ever more important.\n\nThe Department of the Interior\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy of releasing the full Landsat archive at no cost allows everyone to have access to this important resource, allowing researchers in the private sector and at smaller universities to generate even more data applications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 applications that serve commercial endeavors in agriculture and forestry, that enable land managers in and out of government to work more efficiently, and that define and tackle critical environmental issues.\n<h3><strong>The 18<sup>th<\/sup> Pecora Remote Sensing Symposium \u00c2\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\nThe 18<sup>th<\/sup> <a href=\"http:\/\/asprs.org\/pecora18\/\" target=\"_blank\">William T.
