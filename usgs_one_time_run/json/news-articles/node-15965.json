They are critical to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic health. May is the 21<sup>st<\/sup> annual American Wetlands Month, a time to celebrate the essential role wetlands play in giving us food; sheltering us from storms, floods, and coastal erosion; providing habitat for birds, fish, and other wildlife; and cleaning and storing water before returning it to us again.\n<table style=\"width: 170px;border: 1px #ccc solid;float: right\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CoreCast<\/strong>: Wade Into Wetlands Research\n[audio:http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audio\/corecast\/ep156\/20110511_156_wetlands_research.mp3]\n<strong> Slideshow<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/382\">Wade Into Wetland Research <\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\nUSGS scientists provide the critical scientific understanding about how wetlands work and their importance in our lives and the lives of the plants and animals that depend on wetlands for their survival. For example, USGS researchers are examining the vulnerability of North America's prairie potholes to a warming climate.\u00c2\u00a0The loss of wetlands in the prairie pothole region of central North America due to a forecasted warmer and drier climate will adversely affect the millions of waterfowl that depend on the region for food, shelter, and raising young, according to research by the USGS and partners.\n\nCreated in 1991,\u00c2\u00a0American Wetlands Month helps inspire a better understanding of these ecosystems that are so vital to healthy environments and society. Important wetland research like this is happening all across the country \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from sea-level rise to the importance of wetlands for carbon sequestration to constructed wetlands serving as cleaning filters for polluted and contaminated water.

The new research shows that the region appears to be much more sensitive to climate warming and drying than previously thought. A wetland model developed by the authors to understand the impacts of climate change on wetlands in the prairie pothole region projected major reductions in water volume, shortening of the time water remains in wetlands and changes to wetland vegetation dynamics in this 800,000-square kilometer region in the United States (North and South Dakota, Montana, Minnesota and Iowa) and Canada.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1039\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"150\" caption=\"An aerial view of subsiding marshes in the Mississippi River Delta\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/05_10_2011_f30Md55ccw_05_10_2011_12\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-1039  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/03\/marshaerial_klm-150x150.jpg\" alt=\" An aerial view of subsiding marshes in the Mississippi River Delta\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Effects of Elevated CO<sub>2<\/sub> and Climate Change on Coastal Wetlands: <\/strong>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), higher CO<sub>2<\/sub> concentrations in the atmosphere are primarily responsible for recent global warming, which contributes to sea-level rise through thermal expansion of oceans and melting of ice fields.
