From March\u00e2\u0080\u0093May, the rains are expected to total only 60 to 85 percentage of the average rainfall in this region. This is a significant deterioration compared to earlier forecasts. Lower rain amounts would have significant impacts on crop production, rangeland regeneration for livestock, and replenishment of water resources. This would put greater stress on the region, particularly Somalia which is still recovering from a famine <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/article.asp?ID=2867\">declared last year<\/a>, as well as Kenya and Ethiopia which also experienced a severe food crisis.

USGS scientists found that the warming of these oceans affects rainfall over large areas of the Horn of Africa.

The air then rises over the equatorial Indian and Pacific oceans, and flows westward, descending over Africa. Since the air has already lost moisture from rainfall over the oceans, this leads to decreased rain amounts in parts of eastern Africa. Trends toward increased frequency of drought that we are seeing now appear likely to continue into the future as warming continues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEssentially, our research has progressed to the point where we can recognize fairly well the climate patterns linked to the recent droughts, and we hope this helps identify potential bad seasons in advance to raise awareness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Funk. <strong>More Information<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/science-helping-to-save-lives-in-africa\/\">Learn more<\/a> about USGS science helping to save lives in Africa. <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audios\/434\">Listen<\/a> to a podcast interview on FEWS NET and USGS research in Africa.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_173910\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"341\" caption=\"Young boys working in a newly cropped field in Africa.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/04\/cropfield.jpg\"><\/a>[\/caption] Spring rains in the eastern Horn of Africa are projected to begin late this year and be substantially lower than normal.
