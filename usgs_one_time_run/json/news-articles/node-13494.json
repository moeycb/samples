The reason the earthquake was felt so widely was because it was shallow, and geologic conditions in the eastern U.S. allow the effects of earthquakes to spread much more efficiently than in the western U.S.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information and directions visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public_lecture_series\/\">Public Lecture Series website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The lecture is in a federal facility and a photo ID is required for entry.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Those unable to attend the lecture in person can follow it live on Twitter @USGSLive<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["earthquake","","didyoufeelit","","scienceinaction","","Public Lecture","","publicevent"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1320033600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170108"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
