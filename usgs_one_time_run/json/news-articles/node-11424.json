USGS is the only provider of publicly available estimates of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources.<\/p>\r\n<p>New geologic models applied to the Bakken Formation, advances in drilling and production technologies, and recent oil discoveries have resulted in these substantially larger technically recoverable oil volumes. About 105 million barrels of oil were produced from the Bakken Formation by the end of 2007.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS Bakken study was undertaken as part of a nationwide project assessing domestic petroleum basins using standardized methodology and protocol as required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 2000.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Bakken Formation estimate is larger than all other current USGS oil assessments of the lower 48 states and is the largest \"continuous\" oil accumulation ever assessed by the USGS. A \"continuous\" oil accumulation means that the oil resource is dispersed throughout a geologic formation rather than existing as discrete, localized occurrences. The next largest \"continuous\" oil accumulation in the U.S. is in the Austin Chalk of Texas and Louisiana, with an undiscovered estimate of 1.0 billions of barrels of technically recoverable oil.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"It is clear that the Bakken formation contains a significant amount of oil - the question is how much of that oil is recoverable using today's technology?\" said S","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1207800000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169999"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
