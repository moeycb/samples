Media are invited to learn about the innovative U.S. Geological Survey technologies and research being developed to address these challenges at a La Vista, Nebraska conference on Tuesday, May 11.<\/p>\n<p>Streamgages, which monitor floodwater levels, and hydrologic models that predict drying regions and changing snowmelt patterns, generate important information to help understand water-resource challenges. Matt Larsen, USGS Associate Director of Water, will talk about the emerging climate effects on water resources and discuss the role of USGS science in monitoring these resources. Some of the latest technologies employed by the USGS to address water resource issues, including radar and satellite technologies for measuring and transmitting water data, will be available for demonstration and discussion.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHO: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Matt Larsen, USGS Associate Director of Water<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHAT: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>A discussion of the USGS role in addressing water resource challenges, followed by a highly visual opportunity to view new USGS technologies first-hand<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHERE: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>La Vista Courtyard Marriott<br \/> 12560 Westport Parkway<br \/> La Vista, Nebraska<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>WHEN: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Tuesday, May 11 at 8:30 a.m.<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>NOTE: <\/strong><\/td>\r\n<td>Larson will be available to speak with media following the presentation<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Nebraska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","conference","Nebraska","Water Resources","streamgage","floods","Climate Change"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1273464000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169262"},{"tid":"170278"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
