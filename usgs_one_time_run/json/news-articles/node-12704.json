Research in WFRC&rsquo;s six laboratories -- in Seattle; on Marrowstone Island and in the Columbia River Gorge, Wash., in Klamath Falls and Newport, Ore., and Reno, Nev. -- focuses on the environmental factors responsible for the creation, maintenance, and regulation of fish populations and their interactions in aquatic communities and ecosystems.<\/p>\r\n<p>Natural resources of particular interest to the center include Pacific salmon; western trout, char, and resident riverine fishes; desert and inland fishes; and aquatic ecosystems including Puget Sound and the Columbia and Klamath River basins. Current research includes studying fish populations and ecosystems and salmon-wildlife interactions within the Elwha River Restoration Project, the largest dam removal project in U.S. history.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Oregon","Washington","Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Ecosystems Fisheries Aquaticand Endangered Resources","Geographic Areas Northwest"],"distribution":["Biology"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1348459200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169346"},{"tid":"170245"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
