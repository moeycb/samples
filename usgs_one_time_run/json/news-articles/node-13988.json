Safety officials and educators are encouraged to discuss the hazards of volcanoes in their communities. Information about volcanoes and their hazards in Washington state are posted on the <a href=\"http:\/\/volcanoes.usgs.gov\/observatories\/cvo\/\">USGS CVO website.<\/a> Volcano response measures are highlighted on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emd.wa.gov\/\">Washington State Emergency Management Division's website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>For Volcano Awareness Month in 2013, the USGS introduces a new publication entitled, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2013\/3014\/\">Mount St. Helens, 1980 to Now&mdash;What&rsquo;s Going On?<\/a>&rdquo;.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mount St. Helens seized the attention of the world on May 18, 1980 when the largest historical landslide on Earth and a powerful explosive eruption reshaped the volcano, created its distinctive crater, and dramatically modified the surrounding landscape.&nbsp; Fifty-seven people died during that eruption, and more than $1 billion in damages occurred.&nbsp; Quieter eruptions during 1980-1986, and again in 2004-2008 built lava domes within the crater.&nbsp; Scientists at the USGS and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network maintain a dense monitoring network on Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes.<\/p>\r\n<p>This new six-page publication, <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/fs\/2013\/3014\/\">USGS Fact Sheet 2013-3014<\/a>, uses text, photos, graphics, and links to dramatic video clips to summarize eruptive events of 1980-1986 and 2004-2008, and the continuing long-term effects of those eruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional video links provide overviews of monitoring Mount St. Helens, volcano preparedness for the public, and information about the silent forces beneath us that create volcanic eruptions within the Cascade Range.&nbsp; Paper copies of the publication are available from the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory, and from the visitor facilities at Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Oregon","Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Geographic Areas Northwest","Natural Hazards","Natural Hazards Volcano Hazards","volcano","Volcano Awareness Month","washington","Preparedness"],"distribution":["Natural Hazards"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1367812800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169004"},{"tid":"170058"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
