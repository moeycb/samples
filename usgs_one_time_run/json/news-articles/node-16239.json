Scientists applied video camera collars to four female polar bears on the sea ice north of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska this past April and are releasing the first clips of footage that provide unique insight into the daily lives of the bears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe deployed two video cameras in 2013, but did not get any footage because the batteries weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to handle the Arctic temperatures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Todd Atwood, research leader for the USGS Polar Bear Research Program. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe used different cameras this year, and we are thrilled to see that the new cameras worked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe video collars were deployed as part of a new study to understand how polar bears are responding to sea ice loss from climate warming. The study, led by USGS research biologist and University of California Santa Cruz PhD student Anthony Pagano, is taking a close look at polar bear behaviors and energetics.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_197801\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"258\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/06\/PB_TS_2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-197801   \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/06\/PB_TS_2-1024x544.jpg\" alt=\"Point of View 1\" width=\"258\" height=\"137\" \/><\/a> Screen capture of the first polar bear point of view footage. The raw footage was recorded by a camera equipped radio collar that was put on a female polar bear in the Beaufort Sea during April 2014 by the US Geological Survey.[\/caption]\n\nScientists with the USGS have been studying polar bear movement and habitat use for decades using radio and satellite telemetry, mostly used to determine a polar bear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location. New video collars allow scientists to link the location data from the collar with the actual behavior recorded by the cameras.\n\nAlthough these collars were only on for about 8-10 days, scientists can start to understand the activity patterns of polar bears, for example how often they eat, hunt, rest, walk, and swim and how these behaviors may be affected by sea ice conditions and other variables. Ultimately, this information will help scientists examine the energetic rates and nutritional demands of these animals and the potential effects of declining sea ice conditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pagano.\n\nThis ongoing research is part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/alaska.usgs.gov\/science\/interdisciplinary_science\/cae\/index.php\">USGS Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative<\/a>.
