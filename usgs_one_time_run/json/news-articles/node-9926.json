This amount is 16 percent above the drought warning level \r\nand 31 billion gallons less than on July 5, when voluntary water conservation \r\nmeasures were called for by New York City and Westchester County water \r\nmanagers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reservoirs in the Delaware River basin supply about half of New York City&rsquo;s \r\nwater supply. According to a 1954 Supreme Court decree, the Delaware River \r\nMaster is empowered to limit diversions of water from the Delaware River basin, \r\nwith stricter controls in time of drought.<\/p>\r\n<p>In New York state, the flow of the Hudson River continues at below normal \r\nlevels. Last night (Wed., Aug. 2, 1995) the flow at the USGS streamflow \r\nmonitoring station at Hadley, N.Y., was about 628 million gallons per day (mgd), \r\n20 percent below than the long-term average August flow of 773 mgd.<\/p>\r\n<p>The salt front in the Hudson River has retreated in the past week, and is now \r\nabout six miles downstream from the intakes for the city of Poughkeepsie. The \r\nfront was five miles downstream one week ago. The Hudson River is the source of \r\nfresh drinking water for the residents of Poughkeepsie and surrounding \r\ncommunities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Want to know more about our nation&rsquo;s water resources?
