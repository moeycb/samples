This report incorporates data from thousands of historical earthquakes, information about active faults, and models of how earthquake energy travels through the Earth&#39;s crust to define expected levels of ground shaking throughout the country. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe newly released seismic-hazard map of Afghanistan provides government officials, engineers, and private companies who are interested in participating in Afghanistan&#39;s economic growth with crucial information about the location and nature of seismic hazards. This new information will enable officials to make informed decisions about the designs and locations of critical structures such as power plants, dams, pipelines, and hospitals and will facilitate growth and development throughout Afghanistan by designing facilities that can better withstand strong earthquakes. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Who:<\/strong><\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>H.E.
