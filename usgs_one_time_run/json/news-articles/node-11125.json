From field sketching and copper plates, to The National Map and interactive topographic maps, the exhibit traces developments in field surveying, photogrammetry, cartographic compilation, and printing as interwoven threads of the topographic map history of the USGS.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geography","","Topo","Topographic","map",""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1247112000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169750"},{"tid":"170047"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
