A devastating landslide occurred in Washington State, while heavy rains and landslides also hit California. Notable volcanic activity occurred in Alaska, Hawaii and Iceland, with some alerts and eruptions still ongoing. A drought state of emergency was declared in California, and sinkholes have continued to be of heightened interest. USGS scientists also analyzed seismic data to help focus investigations on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.<\/span>&nbsp;<strong>Pop Quiz!<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_science_pick\/usgs-science-pop-quiz\/?from=sp_title\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Take our pop quiz and test your knowledge on natural hazards<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">.

About 20 percent of the United States lies in areas with geology susceptible to sinkholes, known as karst terrain. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/the-science-of-sinkholes\/\">USGS scientists and their state geological survey partners play a key role<\/a> by developing geologic maps of the Nation to help understand where sinkholes are likely to occur and assess potential risk. <strong>Living with Mother Nature in 2015 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Start with Science<\/strong> These events are just a sampling of what occurred in 2014. Mother Nature has many other hazardous faces\u00e2\u0080\u0094from <a href=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\/\">solar storms<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/\">hurricanes<\/a> and additional dangers. Without a doubt, natural hazards will continue, but with an enhanced scientific understanding and effective preparedness, the devastation and destruction can be diminished. The USGS will continue to do its part to research and monitor natural hazards in an effort to keep citizens better informed and prepared.<\/p>\n","safe_summary":""}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24409","uid":"31","filename":"multimediaFile-920.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/multimediaFile-920.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"63819","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"b93e330a-261d-478b-adb5-f8ed9f71f2be","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Debris Flow","drought","earthquakes","floods","hurricanes","landslides","Magnetic Storms","Natural Hazards","Rim Fire","sinkholes","Solar Storms","Storms","volcanoes","wildfire"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1420639200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
