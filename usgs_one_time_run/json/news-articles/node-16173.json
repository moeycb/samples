These are some of the most recognizable locales in the United States, if not the world. The mere mention of these names evokes visions of sun-soaked beaches, warm breezes, glamorous homes, legendary traffic and the vibrant, pulsing buzz of humanity and culture.\n\nYet as locals know, these regions of unparalleled fame and economic importance are also united by another feature:\u00c2\u00a0 devastating wildfires.\n\nSouthern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire ecology is unlike that of anywhere else in the United States. Fire control strategies developed for mountain forests don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same results here. Year after year, wildfires continue to incur tremendous economic and emotional costs to homeowners and communities.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have averaged something like 500 homes per year lost since the 1950\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says U.S. Geological Survey and UCLA fire ecologist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/keeley\">Jon Keeley<\/a>. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow despite very effective fire suppression efforts, the situation seems to have only gotten worse, so that since the year 2000 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve averaged a loss of a thousand homes per year from wildfires.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhy are southern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire losses worsening? What factors drive southern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire risk and fire ecology? Are there solutions that can help southern California communities manage their fire risks, while sustaining native habitats and species?\n\nTo support the many public agencies on the frontlines of fire management, USGS scientists are tackling these questions as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/socalfirerisk\">USGS Southern California Wildfire Risk Scenario Project<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProjectSubWebPage.aspx?SubWebPageID=9&amp;ProjectID=226\">A new film<\/a> introducing this project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=4930\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cLiving with Fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d<\/a> \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seeks to jumpstart conversations about wildfire science in southern California, and is now available on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g-SNFf0xM5g\">USGS YouTube channel<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/videos\/620\">for download<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/08_14_2013_k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013_5\"><img title=\" USGS Scientists Discuss Southern California Fire Ecology\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_14_2013\/k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013\/medium\/Scientists_Meet.jpg\" alt=\"USGS scientists meet with international collaborators on the Southern California Wildfire Risk Scenario Project.

Some studies are assessing the effectiveness of traditional fire management methods like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=4550\">fuel breaks<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=4828\">prescribed fire<\/a>, including unintended consequences such as the spread of flammable nonnative grasses. Other studies are examining the role of human ignitions, especially important because <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/ProjectSubWebPage.aspx?SubWebPageID=9&amp;ProjectID=226\">more than 95 percent of all fires in southern California are caused by humans<\/a>, not by natural sources such as lightning strikes.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g-SNFf0xM5g&amp;t=215\">One important project focus is why some communities burn, and others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t<\/a>, and how home landscaping, home location and housing density alters the probability of home loss from wildfires. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis research is leading us to reverse our thinking about wildfires,\u00e2\u0080\u009d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g-SNFf0xM5g&amp;t=439\">says Keeley in the film<\/a>. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of the traditional from the \u00e2\u0080\u0098wildland-in\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approach, research results are telling us we need to think from the house-out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the wildland side, USGS scientists also are trying to understand the nuanced role of wildfires in southern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s native chaparral ecosystem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn our research, we saw that many small wildlife species had trouble recovering from landscape-scale fires for at least ten years post-fire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says USGS ecologist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/fisher\">Robert Fisher<\/a>, another project leader. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat pattern hints at how catastrophic fires also have lasting impacts on our biological communities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/08_14_2013_k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013_0\"><img title=\"USGS Ecologist Carlton Rochester Handling a Rattlesnake\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/08_14_2013\/k52Rj77IHc_08_14_2013\/medium\/Carlton_Rochester.jpg\" alt=\"USGS Western Ecological Research Center ecologist Carlton Rochester studies the effects of fire on wildlife in San Diego County, Calif.

Ultimately, they hope to integrate all of these wildfire factors into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g-SNFf0xM5g&amp;t=496\">a decision model that can be used by local fire managers and land use planners<\/a>.
