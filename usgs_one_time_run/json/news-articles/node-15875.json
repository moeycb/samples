The USGS public lectures are held monthly in Reston, Virginia. These evening events are free to the public and intended to familiarize a general audience with science issues that are meaningful to their daily lives. USGS speakers are selected for their ability and enthusiasm to share their expertise with an audience that may be unfamiliar with the topic; speakers are encouraged to thoroughly explain the subject matter and to define any words or terms that may be unfamiliar. The USGS lecture series provides the public an opportunity to interact with USGS scientists and ask questions about recent developments in Natural Hazards; Water; Energy Minerals and Environmental Health; Climate and Land Use Change; Ecosystems; and Core Science Systems. Ultimately, the goal is to create a better understanding of the importance and value of USGS science in action.<\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p>[caption id=\"attachment_174437\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"424\" caption=\"Collage: USGS scientists handle a Burmese python in the Everglades; USGS scientists pull in a net full of mostly Bighead Carp ; two USGS scientists display a bighead Carp in the bottom left hand corner.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/06\/Screen-shot-2012-06-05-at-1.43.33-PM.png\"><\/a>[\/caption] Over the last several decades, non-native species have continued to invade sensitive ecosystems in the United States.\u00c2\u00a0 Two high-profile species, Asian carp in the Midwest and Burmese pythons in the Everglades, are the focus of much attention by decision makers, the public and the media.
