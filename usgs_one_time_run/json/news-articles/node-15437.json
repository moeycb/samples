The current level of natural gas development in much of the country, and its effects on the landscape, is an important contemporary land-use\/land-cover issue.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"These studies are part of the larger USGS evaluation of disturbance due to natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania. They show the level of activity in these four counties and will help create a total picture of the level of landscape disturbance in the region in 2010,\"&nbsp;said Terry Slonecker, project lead.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the release of information on the four counties today, the USGS has completed analysis of landscape disturbance in 18 Pennsylvania counties.&nbsp; Results of studies on 17 more counties in the state will be released in the coming months.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Data from these reports will be used to assess the effects of disturbance and land-cover change on wildlife, water quality, invasive species and socioeconomic impacts, among other investigations.<\/p>\r\n<p>The study, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3133\/ofr20131261\">Landscape consequences of natural gas extraction in Sullivan and Wyoming Counties, Pennsylvania, 2004-2010<\/a>,\" by, E.T.
