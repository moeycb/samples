Applications are due May 22, 2014.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Each year the USGS awards earthquake hazards research grants to universities, state geological surveys, and private institutions. Past projects included investigating the Central Virginia Seismic Zone to develop a better understanding of this active seismic zone; examining the paleoseismic record in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska to characterize earthquakes prior to the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964 to better understand future earthquakes in this hazard-prone area; and using GPS to measure ground deformation in the greater Las Vegas area and provide information on how faults will rupture in large, damaging earthquakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>A<span>&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/research\/external\">complete list of funded projects and reports<\/a><span>&nbsp;<\/span>can be found on the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program external research support website.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Natural Hazards","Natural Hazards Earthquake Hazards","Science Qualityand Integrity Educationand Development"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","National News Release"],"distribution":["Natural Hazards"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1395806400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169633"},{"tid":"169342"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
