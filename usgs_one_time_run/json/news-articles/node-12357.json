International scientific cooperation will save lives and reduce property losses from earthquakes.<!--introend--> Working together will increase the resilience of communities in both nations.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the request of the Mexican National Center for Prevention of Disasters (CENAPRED, Centro Nacional de Prevenci&oacute;n de Desastres) of the Ministry of the Interior, the U.S. Northern Command and scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey are providing instruments and training to reinforce the Mexican seismic networks in the region enhancing the measurement of seismic activity in the earthquake-prone zone in northwestern Mexico. This investment is complementary to the financial efforts being undertaken by the Mexican Government.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the April 4, 2010 magnitude 7.2 earthquake in Baja California, CENAPRED relied on the available seismic information provided by USGS. The lack of immediate strong-motion data necessary to evaluate the intensity of the ground shaking, prevented Mexican authorities from assessing the impact of the quake and its affects on the people and infrastructure as rapidly as possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Earthquake faults don't stop at international borders and neither should science. The scientific collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico results in a better understanding of the seismic hazard affecting both nations. This scientific understanding helps protect lives and property on both sides of the border,\" said Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water &amp; Science of the U.S. Department of the Interior.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the 2010 quake, USGS scientists toured the earthquake epicenter area, took measurements, and recommended that Mexican-owned seismometers, if installed in Baja California, would provide both U.S. and Mexican federal, state, and local authorities more accurate and timely information during future quakes. Real-time data provided from these devices installed in Mexico will be used to protect lives and property in both northern Baja California and southern California.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"U.S. Northern Command is partnering with a number of U.S. Government agencies to enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities of Mexican civil and military authorities. With this initiative, U.S. Northern Command is collaborating with USGS to improve seismic monitoring in Baja California. This network complements a number of other projects funded by U.S. Northern Command to enhance the Mexican first responder capabilities with training and equipping projects,\" said Robert Mackay, Chief of the Interagency Coordination Directorate, Humanitarian Assistance Branch of US NORTHCOM.<\/p>\r\n<p>Susan Reinert, Chief of the U.S. Consulate General&rsquo;s Political\/Economic Section in Tijuana, noted, \"The U.S. Government has long acknowledged the need for our two countries to work together to enhance disaster preparedness, especially in the border region where a sizeable earthquake certainly would impact both of our peoples with repercussions far beyond the border.&nbsp; This effort, between the U.S. Geological Survey and Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center, with the support of the U.S. Northern Command, to improve seismic monitoring in Baja California, is emblematic of deep cross-border ties and a spirit of cooperation to achieve an enhanced quality of life.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;\"Earthquakes in Mexico are a threat to the U.S. and visa versa. It's only by cooperating in our monitoring efforts that both countries can fully understand and protect against their earthquake risk,\" said Doug Given, the USGS Southern California Seismic Network coordinator, and the USGS lead for this international project.","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Baja","earthquake","Mexico","international","","","seismic","monitoring","seismograph","Border"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1318996800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169237"},{"tid":"169953"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
