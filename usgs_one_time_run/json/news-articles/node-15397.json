They include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Studying the link between drought and tree death following fires in the Southwest to better estimate the effect of fires on Southwestern forests in the future. <\/li>\r\n<li>Understanding the joint impacts of cool-season precipitation and increasing spring temperatures on snowpack declines and runoff to help address future water management challenges.&nbsp; <\/li>\r\n<li>Examining the impact of increased storms and sea-level rise on connected coastal habitats to support future planning and conservation of nearshore natural resources. <\/li>\r\n<li>Identifying a chronology of extreme storms, especially atmospheric rivers, over the past 30 years and their effect on the Sierra Nevada and western Great Basin ecosystems. <\/li>\r\n<li>Providing customized climate data from across the Southwest region to inform decision-making by private landowners, public agencies and natural resources managers. <\/li>\r\n<li>Assessing climate change vulnerability and adaptation in the Great Basin.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These projects will address some of the most formidable climate challenges in the region, including drought, wildfire, sea-level rise and weather extremes,&rdquo; said Stephen T. Jackson, Interior&rsquo;s Southwest Climate Science Center director.&nbsp; &ldquo;Partnerships between researchers and resource managers will ensure rapid and effective application of new scientific results and insights.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Each of the Department of the Interior's eight&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/csc\/\">Climate Science Centers<\/a> worked with states, tribes, federal agencies, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/landscape-conservation\/lcc.html\">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives<\/a>, universities supporting the CSCs, and other regional partners to identify the highest priority management challenges in need of scientific input, and to solicit and select research projects.<\/p>\r\n<p>The studies will be undertaken by teams of scientists from the universities that comprise the Southwest CSC, from USGS science centers and from other partners such as the states, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA Forest Service, tribal groups, regional and municipal water-management agencies, and the&nbsp;Landscape Conservation Cooperatives in each region.<\/p>\r\n<p>The eight <a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/files\/CSC_consortia_and_regions.pdf\">DOI Climate Science Centers<\/a> form a national network, and are coordinated by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nccwsc.usgs.gov\/\">National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center,<\/a> located at the headquarters of Interior's U.S. Geological Survey.
