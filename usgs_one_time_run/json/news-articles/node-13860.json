PETERSBURG, Fla.<\/strong> &ndash; Nearly three quarters of the coast along the Delmarva   Peninsula is very likely to experience beach and dune erosion as Hurricane Sandy   makes landfall, while overwash is expected along nearly half of the shoreline.<\/p>\n<p>The predictions of coastal change for   the Delaware, Maryland and Virginia peninsula is part of a larger assessment   of probable coastal change released by the U.S. Geological Survey   Friday.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Model forecasts are run anew   for each hurricane, as each case has unique factors in terms of storm   intensity, timing with respect to tides, angle of approach, and must account   for ever-changing details of coastal dune configuration,\" said USGS   Director Marcia McNutt. \"These models help us understand where emergency   management resources might be most needed.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Overwash, the landward movement of large volumes   of sand from overtopped dunes, is forecasted for portions of the east coast with   the projected landfall of the storm. The severity of overwash depends on the   strength of the storm, the height of the dunes, and how direct a hit the   coast takes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;On the Delmarva Peninsula, near   the storm's expected landfall, close to three quarters of the sandy coast is   expected to see beach and dune erosion. Fifteen percent of the coast is very   likely&nbsp;to be inundated by waves and storm surge,&rdquo; said USGS   Oceanographer Hilary Stockdon from the USGS St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine   Science Center.<\/p>\r\n<p>In these areas, waves and storm surge would   transport large amounts of sand across coastal environments, depositing sand both   inland and offshore and causing significant changes to the landscape, Stockdon   noted.<\/p>\r\n<p>The models show that along the New Jersey   shore, 81 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach and dune   erosion, while 7 percent is very likely to experience overwash. It also   indicates that on the south shore of Long Island, N.Y., including Fire Island   National Seashore, 43 percent of the coast is very likely to experience beach   and dune erosion. Overwash and inundation are not expected in these areas   because of the relative high dune elevations. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>According   to USGS geologist Cheryl Hapke, many of the sandy beaches along the mid-Atlantic   Coast have become increasingly vulnerable to significant impacts such as   erosion because of past storms, including Hurricanes Ida (2009) and Irene   (2011), as well as large northeastern storms in 2005 and 2007.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Beaches   and dunes often serve as the first line of defense for coastal communities   against flooding and other hazards associated with extreme storm&rdquo; said Hapke,   &ldquo;Any compromise to these features means that storm-related hazards are more   likely to threaten coastal property, infrastructure, and public safety during   a future extreme storm event.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Beach   and dune erosion occurs when storm surge and waves collide with the base of a   dune, termed collision in the model, and wash away significant amounts of   sand. Overwash happens when these forces exceed dune height and move sand   inland. Inundation is a process by which an entire beach system is submerged   and, in extreme cases, can result in island breaching.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS coastal change model forecasting likely   dune erosion and overwash from the storm can be viewed <a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/sandy\/coastal-change\/\">online<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>For   the latest forecasts on the storm, listen to NOAA radio.&nbsp; For   information on preparing for the storm, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ready.gov\/\">Ready.gov<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.listo.gov\/\">Listo.gov<\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Delaware","Maryland","New Jersey","New York","Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Water National Streamflow Information","Natural Hazards Coastaland Marine Geology","Geographic Areas Northeast","Hurricane Sandy","coastal","Coastal Erosion","","Delaware Bay","Long Island","New Jersey","Delaware","Maryland","Virginia","Water National Streamflow Information Hurricane","hurricanes"],"distribution":["Water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1351310400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169049"},{"tid":"169498"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
