The new streamgage took over measurements October 1. As part of the instrument relocation, agency partners created new educational panels about how scientists collect stream measurements, and how the information is used for flood warnings, recreation, climate change studies and other purposes. A new webcam and meteorological instruments round out the collection of observational equipment installed at Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"68\" valign=\"top\">\r\n<p><strong>Who: <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"446\" valign=\"top\">\r\n<p>Senior   scientists, managers, and officials from USGS, NPS and NWS:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Deanna   Archuleta<\/strong>, Deputy Assistant Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Don   Neubacher<\/strong>, Superintendant, Yosemite National Park<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Eric   Reichard<\/strong>, Director, California Water Science Center, USGS<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Niki   Nicholas<\/strong>, Chief, Resources Management and Science, Yosemite National Park<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Rob   Hartman<\/strong>, Hydrologist in Charge, Colo-Nev.
