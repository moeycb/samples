This year&rsquo;s recipient is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.personal.psu.edu\/cab38\/\">Dr. Cynthia Brewer<\/a> of Penn State University, for her involvement in the development of new symbology for the <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/index.html\">US Topo<\/a> mapping project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Dr. Brewer worked with USGS staff to develop content and symbols for online devices and printed topographic maps with various display sizes and resolutions for a range of scales from 1:5,000 to 1:1,000,000. Her innovations in the use of color, symbols and generalization are now incorporated into a USGS standard for generating topographic maps.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Dr. Brewer is an affiliate faculty member who works with the USGS Center of Excellence for Geospatial Information Science (<a href=\"http:\/\/cegis.usgs.gov\/\">CEGIS<\/a>). She developed and maintains the <a href=\"http:\/\/old.geog.psu.edu\/gouldcenter\/nationalmapping.html\">National Mapping Expertise Exchange program<\/a> which promotes innovation and excellence in national mapping and builds connections among mapmakers, educators, researchers, and software developers at academic, commercial, and governmental organizations.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Additionally, Dr. Brewer directly involves students, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, in her designs and research work, providing a foundation, education and training for the next generation of mapping professionals.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">The National Geospatial Program presents the Henry Gannett Award biennially to commemorate the first USGS Chief Geographer, Henry Gannett (1882-1914), and his many contributions to American geography and cartography.
