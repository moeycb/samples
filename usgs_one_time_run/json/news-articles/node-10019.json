Starting at Mount St. Helens in 1980 and continuing to the present day, USGS scientists have responded to dozens of volcano crises in the United States and elsewhere. By assessing hazards from future eruptions based on a volcano&rsquo;s past behavior, carefully monitoring for signs of restlessness, and keeping public officials informed of the dangers, scientists have helped to save thousands of lives and millions of dollars worth of property throughout the world. \r\n<p>\"Enjoy the movies,\" Tilling said, \"but remember that natural processes like volcanic eruptions only turn into natural disasters when humans get in the way. We can live in harmony with our active volcanoes, but only if we respect their power and plan accordingly.\" \r\n<p>\"Not all hazards from eruptions are limited to the immediate vicinity of the volcano,\" said Dan Dzurisin, scientist-in-charge at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, Wash. \"Huge debris avalanches and associated volcanic mudflows, such as those at Mount St. Helens in 1980, can travel tens of miles down valleys surrounding a volcano. In some cases, it may be safer to be closer to an erupting volcano and on high ground than it is to be farther away and on the floor of a valley.\" \r\n<p>Even more far-reaching than avalanches and mudflows are plumes of volcanic ash, shot high into the atmosphere, that could damage or even bring down an airliner hundreds of miles from an erupting volcano. This has become a serious problem in recent years as air traffic through some of the world&rsquo;s worst \"volcano shooting galleries\" has increased dramatically. \"A prime example is our own Aleutian volcanic chain in Alaska,\" said Terry Keith, scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a facility jointly operated by the USGS, Fairbanks Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, and Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. Every day, dozens of planes fly over or near some of the Aleutian&rsquo;s most active volcanoes. In 1989, a Boeing 747-400 aircraft descended into what appeared to be a thin haze layer while on approach to Anchorage International Airport. In fact, the \"haze\" was volcanic ash from a small eruption of nearby Redoubt volcano. The jumbo jet lost power from all four engines for several agonizing minutes before the crew was able to restart them and land safely. Although no one was injured, damage to the plane was approximately $80 million. To avoid such costly and potentially deadly encounters in the future, the USGS, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Weather Service are working with similar agencies around the world to provide timely warnings of dangerous ash plumes. \"Last year, we installed monitoring equipment on four additional volcanoes in the Aleutians, and this year we&rsquo;ll start monitoring four more,\" said Keith. \r\n<p>Hazards from an erupting volcano can take many forms, including blasts, debris avalanches and debris flows, pyroclastic flows, lava flows, ashfall and poisonous gases. \"By studying a volcano&rsquo;s eruptive history, we can get a pretty good idea of which hazards pose the greatest risks,\" according to USGS researcher Kevin Scott. \"At Mount Rainier, for example, we know that debris flows have repeatedly buried all of the valleys s","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"854773200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
