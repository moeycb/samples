The current version of the tools can create, update, copy, and delete events, import features, measure linear distance, and more. The HEM tools were developed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to help link biologic or water use data to the NHD. These agencies along with the USGS and U.S. EPA are now involved in ongoing collaboration to further develop and support the HEM tools and HEM user community. The presentation will elaborate on the uses of the tools and review real world examples, as well as discuss the importance of hydrography events and the availability of resources to receive training in HEM tools.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Ariel Bates, Tue, July 13, 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 9:45 a.m., San Diego Convention Center Room 25 C&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Diversion structures in the National Hydrography Dataset<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>The National Hydrography Dataset provides a comprehensive representation of the surface water of the United States.
