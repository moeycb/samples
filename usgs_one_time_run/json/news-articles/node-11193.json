It was the first large temblor to jolt the burgeoning urban region since the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1989, the work of the U.S. Geological Survey and other organizations has improved our understanding of the seismic threat in the Bay region, promoted awareness of earthquake hazards, and contributed to more effective strategies to reduce earthquake losses. Scientific, technological, and engineering advances have made the San Francisco Bay Area better prepared today for the next large earthquake in the region.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What:<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span><\/strong>A press conference including short remarks from the U.S. Geological Survey, Caltrans, and the City of Oakland Mayor's office<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>When<\/strong><strong>:<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span><\/strong>Wednesday, October 14, 2009, 11:30 a.m.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Where<\/strong><strong>:<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span><\/strong>Cypress Freeway Memorial Park, Oakland, CA<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em><span class=\"small\">On the SW corner of 14<\/span><\/em><sup><em><span class=\"small\">th<\/span><\/em><\/sup><em><span class=\"small\"> Street and Mandela Parkway\/Cypress Street<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Who<\/strong><strong>:<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Jack Boatwright, USGS Seismologist<\/span><\/strong><br \/><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; David Schwartz, USGS Geologist<br \/><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Representative from City of Oakland<br \/><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> <\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Representative from Caltrans<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal; \">In addition to those making remarks, the following organizations have been invited, and representatives will be available for one-on-one interviews after the press conference:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>FEMA, California Geological Survey, California Emergency Management Agency, BART, PG&amp;E, East Bay Municipal Utility District, San Francisco Municipal Utility District, Structural Engineers Association of Northern California, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, San Francisco Planning + Urban Research Association, California Seismic Safety Commission, and the American Red Cross Bay Area Chapter.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["San","Francisco","geology","earthquake","anniversary","Loma","Prieta","Press","conference","hazards"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1254974400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
