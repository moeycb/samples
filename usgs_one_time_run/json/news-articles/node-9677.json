The report summarizes minerals industry trends according to \r\ncontinent and mineral type and also provides an outlook for domestic minerals \r\ngrowth for 2000. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>This report also provides statistics on the major world production of nearly \r\n90 mineral commodities supported by cooperative information exchange \r\npartnerships with over 60 countries. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Mineral Commodity Summaries 2000: \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The estimated value of U.S. raw nonfuel minerals production in 1999 was over \r\n$39.1 billion, a slight decrease compared with that of 1998, mostly because of \r\nreduced metal prices, and the second decline in as many years. This trend is \r\natypical because the value of domestic minerals production has increased in 31 \r\nof the past 39 years. The top three states for production were California ($3.2 \r\nbillion), Nevada ($2.8 billion), and Arizona ($2.5 billion). Consumption of many \r\nindustrial minerals, especially crushed stone (1.6 billion metric tons) and \r\ncement (111 million metric tons), remained firm in 1999, even though the pace of \r\nnew construction slowed during the latter half of the year. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Imports of processed mineral material were valued at an estimated $62 \r\nbillion, and exports were valued at an estimated $33 billion. Imports of metal \r\nores, concentrates, and raw industrial minerals increased from $3 billion to \r\nalmost $4 billion. Exports of raw minerals remained essentially unchanged at \r\nabout $3 billion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The outlook for the domestic minerals industry in 2000 will depend on a \r\nstrong economy. Many economists in government and industry believe that economic \r\ngrowth in 2000 will take place at a slower pace than in 1999, partly because of \r\nhigher interest rates. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The report \"Mineral Commodity Summaries 2000\" is available for purchase from \r\nthe Superintendent of Documents, P.O.
