Algal blooms are a concern because they can result in taste-and-odor problems for water suppliers and they can produce toxins.

Scientists estimate that water-storage capacity of the multi-purpose pool has been lost to sedimentation at the rate of about 0.25 percent annually.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The sediment analyzed from the bottom of the reservoir did not contain high levels of trace metals. Measured concentrations of trace metals such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and zinc were well below levels at which toxic biological effects frequently occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>More information about USGS sediment studies can be found on the USGS Kansas Water Science Center <a href=\"http:\/\/ks.water.usgs.gov\/studies\/ressed\/\">website<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Kansas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Kansas","Clinton Lake","sediment","Algal Bloom"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1305604800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169262"},{"tid":"169903"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
