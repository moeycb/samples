Smaller glaciers will also result in a decrease of water runoff, and impacts are especially important during the dry late summer when other water sources are limited.<\/p>\r\n<table class=\"podcasttemplate\" style=\"width: 250px;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastheader\">Related Podcasts<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"podcastcontent\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/images\/corecast_rss.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n<p class=\"bold\">The Cold Facts About Melting Glaciers<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/down_arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"download\" width=\"18\" height=\"16\" align=\"absmiddle\" \/> <a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/audio\/corecast\/ep101\/20090807_101_Melting%20Glaciers.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download directly<\/a> |         <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/details.asp?ep=101\">Details<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/CorecastChannel-Usgs\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/podcast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"podcast icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>&nbsp;   \t   <a href=\"http:\/\/phobos.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewPodcast?id=261623315\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/icons\/itunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"itunes icon\" width=\"65\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a><br \/> or  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/default.asp#misc\">subscribe by e-mail<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that most mountain glaciers are shrinking worldwide in response to a warming climate. Measuring changes in glacier mass provides direct insight to the link between glaciers and climate, ultimately helping predict glacier response to anticipated climate conditions,&rdquo; said USGS scientist Edward Josberger.<\/p>\r\n<p>The three glaciers monitored in this study are known as benchmark glaciers. They are widely spaced, represent different climate regimes, and can be used to understand the thousands of other glaciers in nearby regions.<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS scientists study glacier behavior during different seasons, including summer melt and winter snow accumulation, as well as their response to both short and long term climate variations. This allows for more detailed insight regarding how and when the climate is changing.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In addition to these three glaciers, more than 99 percent of America&rsquo;s thousands of large glaciers have long documented records of an overall shrinkage as climate warms,&rdquo; said USGS scientist Bruce Molnia. &ldquo;Many people are surprised to learn that a few glaciers are thickening and advancing. These glaciers are responding to unusual and unique local conditions, including having large, high elevation areas where snow accumulates. Except for these anomalous few , most of America&rsquo;s glaciers are shrinking and these exceptions emphasize how natural variability is an inherent part of a complex Eart","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington","Arkansas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Climate Change","Global Warming","ecosystems","Sea Level Rise","coastal","Alaska","washington","glaciers"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1249876800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169680"},{"tid":"169633"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
