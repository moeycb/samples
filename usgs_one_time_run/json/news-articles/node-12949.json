The productive <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/alaska\/ami_partners.html\">partnership<\/a> between the State government and the USGS is facilitating acquisition of the necessary data to complete digital mapping of Alaska, which is a critical chapter in the history of our geographical knowledge of the North American continent.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The first 400-plus new <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/index.html\">US Topo maps<\/a> for Alaska <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/alaska\/ami_ustopo.html\">are now accessible<\/a> and are the beginning of a multi-year project, ultimately leading to more than 11,000 new maps for the entire state. The goal of the AMI is the production of a complete series of digital topographical maps at a scale of 1:25,000 to replace the 1:63,360-scale maps produced about 50 years ago.
