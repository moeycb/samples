As a result, they propose that <em>G. destructans <\/em>may cause unsustainable dehydration in hibernating bats, triggering thirst-associated arousals.&nbsp; In addition to the direct damage to the wings that would alter flight control, the erosion and invasion of skin may also cause significant changes in circulation, body-temperature regulation and respiratory function.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since signs of the disease were first observed in New York during the winter of 2006-07, the fungus has spread through 11 states and 2 Canadian provinces, resulting in the first sustained high-mortality disease affecting bats in recorded history.&nbsp; Biologists assume that as the disease spreads to new areas, cave-hibernating bats in those areas will also be at risk, including some that are endangered.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The high number of bat deaths and range of species being affected far exceeds the rate and magnitude of any previously known natural or human-caused mortality event in bats, and possibly in any other mammals,&rdquo; said Paul Cryan, a lead author of the paper and a USGS bat ecologist at the Fort Collins Science Center.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the powdery white muzzles of affected bats ga","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New Hampshire","New York","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","Vermont","Virginia","West Virginia","Georgia","North Carolina","Tennessee","Illinois","Indiana","Kentucky","Missouri","Ohio","Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["White Nose Syndrome","","biology","disease","Wildlife Disease","Bat Wings","bats","fungus","Geomyces Destructans"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1292389200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170130"},{"tid":"170238"},{"tid":"169396"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
