The Quaternary period encompasses the past 1.6 million years, and is the period of geologic time that is most relevant to earthquake studies.<\/p><p>The Quaternary Fault and Fold Database has information of interest to the general public, the educational community, and the seismic hazards and engineering communities. A graphical map interface with links to the text descriptions and fault information makes it easy for anyone to locate fault and fold information for a particular area by pointing and clicking. The database can also be searched by a single term or a combination of geologic, geographic, or seismologic terms. If you want a fancier interface, you can opt for the ArcIMS version which allows users to zoom, pan, query, and link to the database, as well as turn on and off geographic layers such as state boundaries, roads, and trench locations.
