The survey will cover the cities of Sacramento, Davis, Fairfield, Oroville, Stockton, Manteca, Tracy and Williams, and numerous other towns in the area with the purpose of collecting and recording geologic measurements.<\/p>\r\n<p>Anyone observing the low-flying plane should not be alarmed when they see it fly over or pass below the horizon. The airplane is operated by experienced pilots who are specially trained for low-level flying.<\/p>\r\n<p>This survey is designed to remotely study geologic and hydrologic units that lie below the land surface. It is part of an ongoing USGS program to identify features such as changes in rock types, ultimately providing a better understanding of the geology and hydrology of the area.<\/p>\r\n<p>The airplane is operated by Firefly Aviation of Calgary, Canada, which is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure flights are in accordance with U.S. law.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Editor:&nbsp; In the public interest and in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, the USGS is announcing this low-level airborne project.&nbsp; Your assistance in informing the local communities is appreciated.<\/strong><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","geophysics","aeromagnetic","Survey","plane","Airplane","Low","San Joaquin","sacramento"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1303704000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169946"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
