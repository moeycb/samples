This information is imperative to local, State and Federal officials in order to forecast floods and coordinate flood-response activities in the affected area. Track streamflow and water levels and access other USGS Hurricane Ike efforts by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/ike\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/ike<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Access real-time data from over 7,500 streamgages across the country by visiting the USGS Water Watch Website at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/waterwatch\/<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>USGS has a network of rugged, inexpensive water-level and barometric-pressure sensors, called storm-surge sensors, which will be installed right before&nbsp;Ike hits land. These sensors provide information about storm surge duration, times of surge arrival and retreat, and maximum depths, which is useful in forecasting and modeling future events. Tropical Storms Katrina and Rita vividly demonstrated that coastal storm surge can be as dangerous as inland flooding caused by rain.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in selected streams and rivers across the United States and does so in cooperation with over 850 federal, state and local agencies.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Contacts:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>If you would like to know more specific information about USGS Hurricane Ike response activities in your area, please contact the appropriate person listed below.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alabama: Athena Clark, 334-395-4141, <a href=\"mailto:athclark@usgs.gov\">athclark@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Florida: Barry Rosen, 407-803-5508, <a href=\"mailto:brosen@usgs.gov\">brosen@usgs.gov<\/a><br \/><\/li>\r\n<li>Georgia: Ed Martin, 770-903-9166, <a href=\"mailto:ehmartin@usgs.gov\">ehmartin@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Louisiana: Charles Demas, 225-298-5481 Ext. 3117, <a href=\"mailto:crdemas@usgs.gov\">crdemas@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Mississippi: Michael Plunkett, 601-933-2940, <a href=\"mailto:plunkett@usgs.gov\">plunkett@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>South Carolina, Eric Strom, 803-750-6109, <a href=\"mailto:ewstrom@usgs.gov\">ewstrom@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Texas: Robert Joseph, 512-927-3500, <a href=\"mailto:rljoseph@usgs.gov\">rljoseph@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>National Flood Specialist: Robert Holmes, 573-308-3581, <a href=\"mailto:bholmes@usgs.gov\">bholmes@usgs.gov <\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Florida","Georgia","Louisiana","Mississippi","Texas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Ike","coastal","coastalchange","flooding","floods","hurricanes","hazards","streamflow","streamgages","Streams","water"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1220587200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168778"},{"tid":"169487"},{"tid":"169607"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
