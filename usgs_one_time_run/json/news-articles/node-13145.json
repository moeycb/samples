The helicopter will be collecting and recording geologic measurements for research purposes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Operated by experienced pilots who are specially trained for low-level flying, the helicopter will fly in a pattern of closely spaced, parallel lines at low heights above ground.&nbsp; The instruments are housed in a tube suspended under the helicopter.<\/p>\r\n<p>This survey is designed to remotely study geologic units that lie below land surface. It is part of an ongoing USGS program to identify features such as changes in rock types, ultimately providing a better understanding of the geology and hydrology of the area.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The helicopter is operated by Siebert &amp; Associates of Anchorage, Alaska, and El Aero of Elko, Nevada.&nbsp; The companies are working with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure flights are in accordance with U.S. law.<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information on similar USGS geophysical research that has been conducted in nearby areas, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/crustal.usgs.gov\/projects\/rgb\/\">Geophysics of Rio Grande Basins website<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Editor:&nbsp; In the public interest and in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, the USGS is announcing this low-level airborne project.&nbsp; Your assistance in informing the local communities is appreciated.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"600\" id=\"gallery_news\" name=\"NR2010_09_29\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photo_shares\/thumbs\/tags\/NR2010_09_29\/1\" title=\"Image Gallery\">[Access images for this release at: &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_09_29\" _mce_href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_09_29\"&amp;amp;amp;gt;http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/tags\/NR2010_09_29&amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;gt;]<\/iframe><br \/><\/strong><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New Mexico"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","Low Level Flights","New Mexico"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1285732800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170026"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
