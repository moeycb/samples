Planners and engineers are users of DOQs; their applications include updating changes in land use, transportation and utility corridors. Uses by government agencies include analysis of vegetation patterns and timber management, wildlife habitat, flood plains, and soil erosion. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nDOQs are available in computer readable format from USGS EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D.
