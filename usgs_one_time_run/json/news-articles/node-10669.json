The project will allow the Landsat data user community to help refine the distribution system planned for the upcoming LDCM. Each scene will be registered to the terrain, or &quot;ortho-rectified,&quot; prior to being placed on the Web. Copies of these data will also be available on CD or DVD at the cost of reproduction. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nLandsat data have proven useful for a wide range of applications. From disaster monitoring after Hurricane Katrina and the Indonesian tsunami to global crop condition analysis, Landsat data are being used by scientists around the world. The Web-based distribution system will allow the user community easier access to Landsat 7 data. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe pilot project will be carefully examined. Customer response will be evaluated and their insight will influence the future distribution system. \r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1180065600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170393"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
