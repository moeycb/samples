Development in the Great Lakes region also has had relatively little effect on basin-wide water availability, though surface-water diversions and pumping of groundwater have affected some flow patterns over large areas of the basin.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This Great Lakes Basin study on water availability and use provides important information for restoration and protection of regional water resources and for guiding appropriate economic development of these resources,&rdquo; said Tim Eder, Great Lakes Commission Executive Director.&nbsp;&ldquo;USGS information on consumptive water use also will be useful to the Great Lakes states and provinces to understand and estimate the cumulative impact of water use on regional water resources.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Understanding the impact of climate variation on water use, lake levels, streamflow and groundwater levels was part of this five-year investigation.
