Hawaii is in production and Alaska production will start later this year.<\/p>\n<p>The first two states to undergo this second US Topo map revision are Kansas and Oklahoma. The 1,403 quadrangles for Kansas and 1,032 quads covering Oklahoma replace the current US Topo maps, which will be added to the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/historical\/index.html\">Historical Topographic Map Collection<\/a>.
