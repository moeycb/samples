The initiative was honored for its relevant new science that will assist resource managers in making decisions concerning the restoration of native aquatic species and their habitats in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The Huron-Erie Corridor Initiative partners have been committed to collaborative restoration activities and research since the early 2000s,\" said Leon Carl, USGS Midwest Regional Director and a founding member of the partnership. \"Ten years later, we're recording the fruits of that commitment through ongoing fish spawning habitat restoration efforts and the development of a strategic restoration plan to carry us into the next ten years and beyond.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>Partners in Conservation<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Awards<\/em> recognize outstanding examples of conservation legacies achieved when DOI engages groups and individuals representing a wide range of backgrounds, ages and interests to work collaboratively to renew lands and resources. The achievements of the Huron-Erie Corridor Initiative have been realized through the outstanding participation of diverse organizations on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.<\/p>\r\n<p>The St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, also known as the Huron-Erie corridor, are the international waters that connect Lake Huron to Lake Erie and provide habitat for over 65 species of fish. The region, which includes the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge and the Detroit International Wildlife Refuge, is part of the central Great Lakes flyway for millions of migratory waterfowl. It contains some of the largest and most diverse wetlands remaining in the region.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am indeed so proud of all these public and private partners who are working together on sound science in support of restoring this ecological corridor,&rdquo; said Congressman John D. Dingell.&nbsp; &ldquo;This critically important work is not only supporting the restoration of fish and wildlife populations, and their requisite habitats, but it is helping bring conservation into a major urban area where nearly seven million people live in the watershed and thereby helping develop the next generation of conservationists.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Environmental changes in the corridor over time have resulted in the loss of habitat for fish and other organisms. The partners developed a plan to increase habitat for lake whitefish, lake sturgeon, walleye and other native fish populations, based on research suggesting that water flow, depth and temperature are important","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Michigan","Ohio"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["ecosystems","restoration","Lake Huron","Lake Erie","Michigan","Ohio","Ontario","","Awards","ecology","Great Lakes Science Center","Huron Erie Corridor Initiative","Michigan Sea Grant","","biology"],"distribution":["Biology"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1389848400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169341"},{"tid":"169645"},{"tid":"170026"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
