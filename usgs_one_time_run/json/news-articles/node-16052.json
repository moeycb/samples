While the current monitoring system delivers earthquake information rapidly and reliably, seismologists are concerned that it will not fully record the damaging earthquakes that scientists have forecasted will occur. USGS scientists, however, have developed a cost-effective solution.\n\n<strong>What is <\/strong><strong>NetQuakes?<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>\n\nNetQuakes is a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccitizen-science\u00e2\u0080\u009d program, developed in Menlo Park, Calif., by the <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/\">USGS Earthquake Hazards Program<\/a> , that offers the public the opportunity to help seismologists record earthquakes by hosting portable, low-maintenance sensors in private homes, public buildings, schools, and churches \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and not just in the earthquake zones of California, but wherever seismic activity is a concern in the Nation. <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/monitoring\/netquakes\/map\/\">Hundreds of volunteers<\/a> now host NetQuakes instruments, which transmit seismic data via Wi-Fi networks and the Internet to the USGS.\n\nThe NetQuakes project began in 2009 and was born of observations that came out of the September 2004 <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/research\/parkfield\/2004.php\">M6.0 earthquake near Parkfield, Calif<\/a>.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe learned from the Parkfield earthquake that intensity of ground motion amplitudes vary far more than we had believed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said USGS geophysicist Jim Luetgert. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had thought that sensors placed miles apart would give a good representation of the variations in shaking. But the Parkfield earthquake showed that a much closer spacing is needed to adequately map that variability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complicated and expensive to place traditional seismographs in the urban areas that have sprung up in many seismically active areas. Traditional seismographic stations often require:\n<ul>\n\t<li>additional construction, such as a poured concrete foundation,<\/li>\n\t<li>vandal-proof enclosures,<\/li>\n\t<li>costly equipment that takes up the same space as a refrigerator, and<\/li>\n\t<li>costs about $50 to transmit seismic data per station per month.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nThe NetQuakes instrument, in contrast, comes in an aluminum box the size and shape of a car battery. The instrument is attached to a metal baseplate that is bolted onto a foundation or floor. Rather than using GPS to keep accurate time as many traditional seismographs do, NetQuakes uses the network time protocol used by personal computers, which queries established Internet servers.\n\nThe instruments communicate occasionally with USGS computers, and telemetry is free to the USGS because hosts allow the instrument to communicate over their household Internet service. A 2GB-flash drive stores two weeks of data in case Internet communications fail in an earthquake. The instruments rely on power from a wall outlet, but contain an easily replaced internal battery to power the instrument for up to 36 hours should electricity fail.\n\nThe researchers are not looking to NetQuakes to record low-magnitude earthquakes or for rapid determination of location and magnitude, which is the role of the existing seismographic networks. Rather, they want to record how ground motion varies across a densely spaced array of high-quality sensors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially during the largest earthquakes, which can produce ground accelerations up to three times the acceleration of gravity (3g).\n\nEconomically deploying large numbers of instruments has required some compromises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTradeoffs include levels of sensitivity and a few minutes of response-time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luetgert said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe data are available within 10 minutes after the earthquake and are automatically incorporated into ShakeMap updates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the first deployments, organizers sought a few volunteers from engineer and scientist friends near Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley, where the Hayward Fault runs right through California Memorial Stadium. Today there are more than 130 NetQuakes instruments in the San Francisco Bay Area. Instruments have also been distributed to each of the regional networks in the USGS Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). Luetgert noted that great progress has also been made in the Seattle area, which now has more than 80 NetQuakes instruments hosted by volunteers.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Traditional seismic stations such as this one require a source of power (solar here), a poured concrete foundation and several square feet of space. They are not always practical to install in urban areas, and that&#039;s where NetQuakes comes in.\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/04_11_2012\/imd5GsrFFA_04_11_2012\/medium\/NEA-site.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" \/>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>The Portability of NetQuakes Has Advantages<\/strong>\n\nInterest elsewhere has followed earthquake activity. Three years ago a swarm of small earthquakes in central Oklahoma occurred in an area devoid of seismic instruments, so Luetgert sent five instruments to NetQuake volunteers in that area. NetQuakes instruments were also deployed in the epicentral region of the <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/recenteqsww\/Quakes\/se082311a.php#summary\">August 2011 M5.8 earthquake near Charlottesville, Va.<\/a>, to locate aftershocks, as well as in the damaged National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Three NetQuakes instruments were deployed near Youngstown, Ohio, to record earthquakes suspected to be induced by fluid injection in a deep well.\n\nNetQuakes data are also being used to help resource managers and public agencies monitor shaking at critical facilities. The East Bay Municipal Utility District is partnering with the USGS to monitor ground motion at its suburban dams and reservoirs near the Hayward Fault in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMagnitude 6.8 earthquakes rupture the Hayward Fault on average every 140 years, and one may be coming due,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luetgert noted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would like to be ready to record that earthquake with high-quality seismic instrumentation from a dense network to document the effects of the shaking in an urban area. This will enable engineers to better understand why buildings didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand up to the shaking, and ultimately how to build structures that can resist shaking from future quakes. NetQuakes provides a cost-effective way to achieve that goal with the help of the public.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong>Related stories:<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/online.wr.usgs.gov\/calendar\/\">USGS Menlo Park Evening Public Lecture: Shake Alert!<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/join-citizens-and-scientists-tracking-the-pulse-of-our-planet\/\">Join Citizens and scientists tracking the pulse of our planet<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/is-the-recent-increase-in-felt-earthquakes-in-the-central-us-natural-or-manmade\/?from=title\">Is the recent increase in felt earthquakes in the central U.S. natural or manmade?<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/oklahoma-struck-by-series-of-quakes\/\">Oklahoma struck by series of quakes<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/5-8-earthquake-in-virginia\/\">5.8 earthquake in Virginia<\/a>\n\n<strong>Earthquake Hazards Program deformation data sites:<\/strong>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/monitoring\/deformation\/data\/?region=PK\">Parkfield<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/monitoring\/deformation\/data\/?region=SF\">San Francisco Bay Area<\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/monitoring\/deformation\/data\/?region=SC\">Southern California<\/a>\n\n&nbsp;","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24204","uid":"31","filename":"carrizo2-lrg.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/carrizo2-lrg.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"27151","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"e659d89c-f853-4839-85ff-e6372d3d9da4","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":333,"width":500},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["California","Citizen Science","earthquakes","Natural Hazards"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1336659356","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
