Morris, Jr. &ldquo;Lionfish will likely compete with native species adding yet another problem for our already-stressed coral reefs.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>To help prevent the establishment of new non-native fishes in Florida's marine waters, the USGS, NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, and REEF published the new field guide as part of their efforts to detect and remove non-native marine fishes as soon as they are discovered.&nbsp; The guide provides descriptions of non-native marine fish species that have been seen along Florida&rsquo;s coasts, and includes maps of the sightings.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We published this guide as a tool for preventing non-native fishes from becoming established,&rdquo; said Dr. Schofield.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tracking sightings of all the non-native fishes listed in this field guide.&nbsp; We hope that divers, fisherman, and others will use the guide to report non-natives right away and help prevent what happened with the lionfish.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Field Guide to Nonindigenous Marine Fishes of Florida was authored by Pam Schofield (USGS), James A.
