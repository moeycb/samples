ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services), one of the first methods to seamlessly integrate spatial data, modeling, and mapping, adopts a convention for evaluating ecosystem services that places society&rsquo;s needs and natural processes on equal footing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A new U.S. Geological Survey article published recently in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0091001\">PLOS ONE<\/a> outlines the ARIES framework and how it can aid in better understanding nature&rsquo;s value to society &mdash; today and under future scenarios for climate and land use change, energy and minerals extraction, water resources management, natural hazard impacts, and natural resource conservation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"This methodological advance is designed to integrate diverse data and models more quickly and accurately, using principles from semantic meta-modeling and big data,\" said Ken Bagstad, USGS researcher and contributing author of the paper. \"This is not just another tool for environmental assessment, but rather a new and different way to look at the linkages between people, nature, and the economy.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The ARIES methodology has been in development since 2007 and used in case studies since 2010. A variety of government and academic partners have contributed to its development, including the USGS, Basque Centre for Climate Change, University of Vermont, Conservation International and Earth Economics.&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["ecosystems","","","method","modeling Climateand Land Use Change","Climateand Land Use Change Geographic Analysisand Monitoring","Climateand Land Use Change Researchand Development","Geographic Areas Southwest"],"article_type":["Technical Announcement","State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1395201600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169491"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"0","format":null,"safe_value":"0"}]}}
