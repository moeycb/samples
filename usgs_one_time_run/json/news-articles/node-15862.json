Of the hydrates likely to become unstable, few are likely to release methane that could reach the atmosphere and intensify global warming.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173216\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"202\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Map.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-173216  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Map.jpg\" alt=\"Map of Observed and Inferred Locations of Gas Hydrates\" width=\"202\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a> Figure 1: Gas hydrates have been found in many locations worldwide. Scientists predict that they occur in many areas that have not yet been surveyed.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Background:<\/strong> Gas hydrates are an ice-like combination of natural gas and water that can form in deep-water ocean sediments near the continents, and within or beneath continuous permafrost in the circum-Arctic. Specific temperatures and pressures and an ample supply of natural gas are required for gas hydrates to form and remain stable.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173218\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"224\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Pigeon.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-173218 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Pigeon.jpg\" alt=\"Gas Hydrate Sample\" width=\"224\" height=\"184\" \/><\/a> Figure 2: Solid gas hydrate recovered from sediments about 20 feet below the seafloor near Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vancouver Island[\/caption]\n\nAn estimated 99 percent of gas hydrates are in ocean sediments, with the remaining 1 percent in permafrost areas (fig.1). Methane hydrate or \u00e2\u0080\u009cmethane ice\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the most common type of gas hydrate (fig. 2). It is a highly concentrated form of methane. One cubic foot of methane hydrate traps about 164 cubic feet of methane gas.\n\nThe amount of methane trapped in the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrate deposits is uncertain, but even the most conservative estimates conclude that about 1000 times more methane is trapped in hydrates than is consumed annually worldwide.

A warming climate could cause gas hydrates to break down (dissociate), releasing the methane that they now trap.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas. A given volume of methane causes 15 to 20 times more greenhouse gas warming than carbon dioxide, so the release of large quantities of methane to the atmosphere could exacerbate atmospheric warming and cause more gas hydrates to destabilize (fig. 4).\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173215\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"196\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Flowchart.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-173215 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Flowchart.jpg\" alt=\"A Chart showing how as climate warms, more hydrates melt, releasing more methane gas, which acts as a greenhouse gas, causing climatic warming, thus perpetuating the cycle.\" width=\"196\" height=\"161\" \/><\/a> Figure 4: Schematic of the theoretical scenario -- Arctic methane emissions from gas hydrates and increased climate warming.[\/caption]\n\nSome research suggests that this has happened in the past. Extreme warming during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum about 55 million years ago may have been related to a large-scale release of global methane hydrates. Some scientists have also advanced the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis to explain observations that may be consistent with repeated, catastrophic dissociation of gas hydrates and triggering of submarine landslides during the Late Quaternary (400,000 to 10,000 years ago).\n\n<strong>Methane in the Atmosphere: Current Observations <\/strong>\n\nThe atmospheric concentration of methane, like that of carbon dioxide, has increased since the onset of the Industrial Revolution (fig. 5). Methane in the atmosphere comes from many sources, including wetlands, rice cultivation, termites, cows and other ruminants, forest fires, and fossil fuel production (fig. 6). Some researchers have estimated that up to 2 percent of atmospheric methane may originate with dissociation of global gas hydrates. Currently, scientists do not have a tool to say with certainty how much, or if any, atmospheric methane comes from hydrates.\n\nAlthough methane is a potent greenhouse gas, it does not remain in the atmosphere for long. Within about 10 years, it is transformed to carbon dioxide. Thus, methane that is released to the atmosphere ultimately adds to the amount of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173228\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"146\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-173228  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Chart-227x300.jpg\" alt=\"Charts showing the comparative atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and Methane\" width=\"146\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a> Figure 5: Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide in parts per million and methane in parts per billion.

While the vast majority of methane hydrates would require a sustained warming over thousands of years to trigger dissociation, gas hydrates in some locations are dissociating now in response to short-term and long-term climate processes.\n\nThe following discussion refers to the numbered type locales or sectors, shown in Figure 7.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173229\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"604\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Ocean-Crosssection.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-173229\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/GH-Ocean-Crosssection.jpg\" alt=\"Ocean Cross-Section Showing Gas Hydrate Deposits by Sector\" width=\"604\" height=\"369\" \/><\/a> Figure 7: Gas hydrate deposits by sector. Currently, gas hydrates are most likely dissociating in sectors 2 and 3. Only sector 2 is likely to release methane that could reach the atmosphere. Figure modified from Ruppel (2011).[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Sector 1, Thick Onshore Permafrost:<\/strong> Gas hydrates that occur within or beneath thick terrestrial permafrost will remain largely stable even if climate warming lasts hundreds of years. Over thousands of years, warming could cause gas hydrates at the top of the stability zone, about 625 feet below the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, to begin to dissociate.\n\n<strong>Sector 2, Shallow Arctic Shelf:<\/strong> The shallow water continental shelves that circle parts of the Arctic Ocean were formed when sea level rise during the past 10,000 years inundated permafrost that was at the coastline. Subsea permafrost is thawing beneath these continental shelves and associated methane hydrates are likely dissociating now. If methane from these gas hydrates rises to the ocean floor, it will likely reach the atmosphere. Less than one percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas hydrates probably occur in this setting, but this estimate could be revised as scientists learn more.\n\n<strong>Sector 3, Upper Edge of Stability:<\/strong> Gas hydrates on upper continental slopes, beneath 1000 to 1600 feet of water, lie at the shallowest water depth for which methane hydrates are stable. The upper continental slopes, which ring all of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continents, could host gas hydrate in zones that are roughly 30 feet thick. Warming ocean waters could completely dissociate these gas hydrates in less than 100 years. Methane emitted at these water depths will probably oxidize in the water column or simply dissolve and is not likely to reach the atmosphere. About 3.5 percent of the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas hydrates occur in this climate sensitive setting.\n\n<strong>Sector 4, Deepwater:<\/strong> Most of the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas hydrates, about 95 percent, occur in water depths greater than 3000 feet. They are likely to remain stable even with a sustained increase in bottom temperatures over thousands of years. Most of the gas hydrates in these settings occur deep within the sediments. If they do dissociate, the released methane should remain trapped in the sediments, migrate upward to form new gas hydrates, or be consumed by oxidation in near-seafloor sediments. Most methane released at the seafloor would likely dissolve or be oxidized in the water column.
