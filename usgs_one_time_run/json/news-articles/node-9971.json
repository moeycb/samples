{"title":"striking USGS Image Shows Alaska In A New Light","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>\nA computer-generated map published by the U.S. Geological Survey provides a striking portrayal of Alaska&rsquo;s varied landscape. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough the map resembles a satellite-generated photograph, it was actually created by the computer processing of 96 million elevation points to simulate the state&rsquo;s landscape as it would look if lit by the sun from a low angle. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nMountain ranges, lowlands, and lakes are readily apparent, as is the active Denali fault that cuts through some of Alaska&rsquo;s highest mountains, including Mount McKinley, in central Alaska. In southeastern Alaska, the active Fairweather fault, which is the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates, can be seen. These and other faults mark major geologic boundaries in the giant patchwork of crustal fragments that have migrated, some thousands of miles, and seamed together over geologic time to form Alaska. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nA closer inspection reveals a multitude of details. Deposits marking the past positions of glaciers during the Ice Ages, as well as many of Alaska&rsquo;s active volcanoes, are readily located. In addition, subtle alignments of valleys that have not been depicted before can be identified on the new image. These subtle features are the result of crustal forces in the recent geologic past, so the map should help to better understand the geologic processes that have helped to shape Alaska&rsquo;s landscape, according to USGS authors of the map. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn accompanying booklet explains more than 100 features that can be seen on the image. The map and booklet should prove both interesting and useful to earth scientists, teachers and anyone else interested in the state&rsquo;s vast landscape. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nInformation on how to order a $4 paper copy (plus $3.50 handling fee) of the 3x4-foot &quot;Digital Shaded-Relief Image of Alaska,&quot; and its accompanying booklet is available by calling 1-800-ASK-USGS.
