The cards record more than a century of information about bird migration, a veritable treasure trove for climate-change researchers because they will help them unravel the effects of climate change on bird behavior, said Jessica Zelt, coordinator of the North American Bird Phenology Program at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center.<\/p>\r\n<p>That is -- once the cards are transcribed and put into a scientific database.<\/p>\r\n<p>And that's where citizens across the country come in - the program needs help from birders and others across the nation to transcribe those cards into usable scientific information.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"These cards, once transcribed, will provide over 90 years of data, an unprecedented amount of information describing bird distributions, migration timing, and migration pathways and how they are changing,\" said Zelt. \"There is no other program that has the same historical depth of information that can help us understand the effect that global climate change has on bird populations across the country. When combined with current information, scientists will better understand how birds are responding to climate change and how to develop tools to help manage that change, especially for at-risk species.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The millions of hand-scribbled cards sit in row upon row of federal green filing cabinets of ancient vintage in a modest and fittingly old office dating from before WWII. The cards contain almost all of what was known of bird distribution and natural history from the Second World War back to the later part of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century, said USGS senior scientist Chan Robbins, who kept track of the cards'whereabouts in attics and basements during the intervening years.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"When I go through the files, it is just amazing some of the stories that are recorded there,\" said Jessica Zelt, who is an avid birder herself. \"For example, one of our online participants recently wrote to tell me she had transcribed a migration card on purple martins by American ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice from 1926. It is exciting to see people today being linked to a piece of birding history.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Participants recorded their name, locality and year, along with arrival and departure dates, date of abundance, and whether it was a species common in t","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Texas","Michigan"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["biology","Climate Change"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1237348800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169017"},{"tid":"169637"},{"tid":"170412"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
