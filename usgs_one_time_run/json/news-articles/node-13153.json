Initially the Haiti earthquake was thought to be the consequence of movement along a single fault, which accommodates the motion between the Caribbean and North American plates.<\/p>\r\n<p>By modeling the patterns of surface deformation, the team was able to assess which fault was responsible. Their results showed that the earthquake may not have been caused by the simple rupture of a single fault, but instead may have involved a complex series of faults.<\/p>\r\n<p>The pattern of surface deformation was dominated by movement on a previously unknown, subsurface thrust fault, named the L&eacute;og&acirc;ne fault, which did not rupture the surface.<\/p>\r\n<p>Hayes, a post-doctoral researcher, is&nbsp;contracted to work for the USGS by Synergetics, Inc.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is one of several papers to be published this month in a special issue of &nbsp;<em>Nature Geoscience<\/em> on the Haiti earthquake.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Haiti","earthquake","geology","Nature Geoscience","San Andreas Fault"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1286683200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169491"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
