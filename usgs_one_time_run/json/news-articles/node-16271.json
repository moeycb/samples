The USGS is a proud founder and supporter of ShakeOut. You can join the drill by\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/\">registering to participate<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0and practicing how you will protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community during an earthquake.\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">During the drill, participants practice \u00e2\u0080\u009c<strong>Drop, Cover, and Hold On<\/strong>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/dropcoverholdon\/\">This is the recommended safety action<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0to take during an earthquake.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/california\/scenario\/\">ShakeOut began<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0in California in 2008 and has since spread to other states and regions and now internationally as well. The first Central U.S. ShakeOut was held in 2011, and the first SouthEast ShakeOut in 2012. This year 47 states and U.S. territories, and several other countries, are officially involved. People and organizations in all other states and countries can also register their drills through the ShakeOut site.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>Sign Up and ShakeOut<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Although the International ShakeOut Day of Action is just days away, it is not too late to register to participate (drills can even be registered and held any day through the end of the year).\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/register\/index.html\">Mark your calendar and register<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0for the ShakeOut drill near you. Families, schools, businesses, and organizations can all sign up and get involved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">There are many ways to participate, and a variety of\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/howtoparticipate\">resources and tips are provided online<\/a>. This includes pre-made flyers, drill broadcast recordings, drill manuals, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"455\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Graphic-Drop-Cover-and-Hold-On.jpg\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/10\/Graphic-Drop-Cover-and-Hold-On.jpg\" alt=\"Drop, Coner and Hold On\" width=\"455\" height=\"152\" \/><\/a> During an earthquake, the recommended safety action is to \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrop, Cover, and Hold On.\u00e2\u0080\u009d[\/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you want to find out how intense ground shaking could be from an earthquake near you, check out the recently released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_top_story\/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards\/\">2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps<\/a>.

If you are indoors, you should \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrop, Cover, and Hold On.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it securely. If you are not near a desk or table, drop to the floor against an interior wall, then protect your head and neck with your arms. Avoid exterior walls, windows, hanging objects, mirrors, tall furniture, large appliances, and kitchen cabinets filled with heavy objects or glass.\n\nWhile on the ground, look around and see what objects could fall during a potential earthquake, and make sure to secure or move those items after the drill.\n\nIf you happen to be outdoors, move to a clear and open area if you can do so. Avoid power lines, trees, signs, buildings, vehicles, and other items that can fall on you. If you are driving, pull over to the side of the road and set the parking brake. Do not stop under bridges, overpasses, power lines, or traffic signs. If you were in a real earthquake, make sure to remain inside the vehicle until the shaking has stopped.\n\n<strong>USGS Science in ShakeOut<\/strong>\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/prepare\/\">USGS has created and provides<\/a> information tools to support earthquake loss reduction, including hazard assessments, scenarios, comprehensive real-time earthquake monitoring, and public preparedness handbooks. USGS science provides the basis for <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/circ\/1324\/\">earthquake scenarios<\/a> that shape preparedness exercises such as the ShakeOut. USGS earthquake hazards research helps emergency managers understand where earthquakes occur and what the potential damages and losses would be.\n\nThe original ShakeOut was based on a comprehensive analysis of a major earthquake in southern California known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ShakeOut Scenario.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That project was completed in 2008 and led by the USGS and many partners as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shakeout.org\/scenario\/\">demonstration<\/a> of how science can be applied to reduce risks related to natural hazards. The concept and organization of a public drill came out of the collaboration between the USGS, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scec.org\/\">Southern California Earthquake Center<\/a> (SCEC), and other partners through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.earthquakecountry.info\/\">Earthquake Country Alliance<\/a> (ECA). SCEC is a research consortium funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and USGS. ECA is a public-private partnership of people, organizations, and regional alliances that is led by SCEC and work together to improve preparedness, mitigation, and resilience by supporting and coordinating efforts that improve earthquake and tsunami resilience.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"486\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/National-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/07\/National-Map.jpg\" alt=\"National Seismic Hazard Map\" width=\"486\" height=\"324\" \/><\/a> 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Map, displaying intensity of potential ground shaking from an earthquake in 50 years (which is the typical lifetime of a building).[\/caption]\n\nThe success of the 2008 ShakeOut spurred the organizers at ECA to take the concept worldwide, and turn it into an annual day of disaster preparedness activities. Nationwide, ShakeOut activities are now coordinated and supported by many agencies and partners including the USGS, SCEC, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), NSF, the Central U.S. Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC), the American Red Cross, and others.\n\nThe USGS provides rapid alerts of potential impacts from an earthquake through its <a href=\"http:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthquakes\/pager\/\">Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response (PAGER)<\/a> \u00c2\u00a0system.
