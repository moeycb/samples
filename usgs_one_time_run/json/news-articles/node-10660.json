USGS scientists use a variety of tools to uncover evidence of abrupt climate change including tree-ring patterns, ocean and lake sediments, geochemistry, micropaleontology, and climate modeling.&nbsp; The ecosystem responses to these rapid changes in climate are the topic of the 23rd Pacific Climate Workshop (PACLIM) which will be held May 13-16, 2007.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nOrganized and partially funded by the USGS, the conference brings together university, state, and federal government scientists from around the country for presentations and discussions on various aspects of climate variability, from the impact of rapid warming on the Sierra Nevada snowpack and the role of sea surface temperature in the drying of coastal California, to the record of freshwater variability over the past several thousand years in San Francisco Bay marshes and changes is vegetation distribution in the southwest and indicators of a possible warmer future in the western U.S.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs noted in the schedule below, USGS scientists will be presenting the results of new analyses on the connection between sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean and precipitation in the Great Basin (Benson), the increased risk of flooding in a warmer world (Dettinger, Cayan, Florsheim, and Lundquist), changing in storm intensity and frequency in southwestern California (Miller, Mahan, McGeehin, Barron, and Owen), vegetation response to rapid climate change (Shafer, Bartlein, Edwards, and Hostetler), and the impact of climate change on the Navajo Nation (Redsteer).\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nDownload the complete <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/psw\/cirmount\/meetings\/pdf\/PACLIM2007_program0507.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda for the 23rd Pacific Climate Workshop<\/a>  (PDF, 100KB). \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Highlighted USGS research to be presented at the Pacific Climate Workshop<\/strong>\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<span class=\"fontSize3\"><strong>Oral Presentations<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\r\nAll oral presentations will be held in the Fred Farr Forum, Asilomar Conference Grounds\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Santa Barbara basin diatom record suggests coincidence of cooler SST with widespread occurrence of drought in the west during the past 2,200 years.<\/strong><br \/>\r\nJohn Barron (USGS, Menlo Park, Calif.) - Tuesday, May 15, 11:25-11:50 a.m.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>The relation of Great Basin late Quaternary hydrologic and cryologic variability to North Atlantic climate oscillations<\/strong><br \/>\r\nLarry Benson (USGS, Boulder, Colo.) - Monday, May 14, 3:30-3:55 p.m.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Post-Younger Dryas warming, an analog for the next 100 years?<\/strong><br \/>\r\nKenneth Cole (USGS, Flagstaff, Ariz.) - Tuesday, May 15, 2:45-3:10 p.m.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Rain-fed flood risks in a warming west<\/strong><br \/>\r\nMichael Dettinger (USGS, UCSD-SIO), Dan Cayan (USGS, UCSD-SIO), Jessica Lundquist (University of Washington) - Monday, May 14","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1178856000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169946"},{"tid":"170444"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
