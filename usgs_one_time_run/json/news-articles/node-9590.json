The National Weather Service reports the yearly rainfall was above normal at BWI Airport (103 percent) and Wilmington (108 percent), but from October through December, rainfall at BWI was 5.58 inches less than normal. This unusually dry autumn resulted in the lower yearly average streamflow into the Chesapeake Bay (see graphs at <a href=\"http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/monthly\/bay.html\">http:\/\/md.water.usgs.gov\/monthly\/bay.html<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p>Although rainfall was below average in December, with only 2.31 inches at BWI in December, which is about 68 percent of the normal monthly rainfall, streamflow across Maryland and Delaware ranged from 48 percent below normal at the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., to 45 percent above normal for the Eastern Shore and Delaware. The Baltimore reservoir system is currently at 97 percent of capacity, and ground-water levels increased and are in the normal range for Maryland and Delaware.
