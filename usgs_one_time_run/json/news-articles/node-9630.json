{"title":"statement Of USGS Director Chip Groat on 100th Anniversary of Galveston Hurricane","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>One hundred years ago, the deadliest natural disaster ever to strike the United States made landfall in Galveston, Texas. The 1900 Galveston hurricane took at least 6,000 lives and perhaps as many as 10,000. <\/p>\n<p>Hurricanes, like other forces of nature, will always pose a threat. But thanks to a century of improvements in scientific monitoring and in our understanding of how the Earth works, the loss of life from natural disasters has dropped dramatically. The USGS is working with our partners to improve our ability to predict coastal change caused by severe storms. With this information, communities can be better prepared for nature&rsquo;s extremes. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS is committed to providing the scientific information America needs to build safer communities, so that tragedies like Galveston need never happen again. <\/p>\r\n<p>Chip Groat<br>Director<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Links to information on hurricanes:<\/b> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>USGS:<br>Hurricane and Extreme Storm Impact Studies:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/\">http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Images of flooding from Hurricane Floyd:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/ncflood\/ncflood.html\">http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/ncflood\/ncflood.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Information and links on Hurricane Mitch:<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/events\/mitch\/cent_amer.html\">http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/events\/mitch\/cent_amer.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Forecasting hurricane occurrence, economic and life losses:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricane_forecast\/\">http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricane_forecast\/<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Fact sheets on hazards including hurricanes:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/wid\/index-hazards.html\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/wid\/index-hazards.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>NOAA<br>Information on Galveston hurricane:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/galveston1900\/\">http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/galveston1900\/<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>National Hurricane Center:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.nhc.noaa.gov\/index.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>FEMA information on hurricanes:<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/fema\/trop.htm\">http:\/\/www.fema.gov\/fema\/trop.htm<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>American Red Cross<br>Preparing for a Hurricane:<\/b> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.redcross.org\/disaster\/safety\/hurrican.html\">http:\/\/www.redcross.org\/disaster\/safety\/hurrican.html<\/a> <\/p>\r\n<p><b>The Galveston hurricane:<\/b><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.redcross.org\/news\/galveston\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.redcross.org\/news\/galveston\/index.html<\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"968385600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169822"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
