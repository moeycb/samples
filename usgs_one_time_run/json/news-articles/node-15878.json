During the Spring and Summer of 2011, flooding associated with snowmelt and rain devastated the Central U.S. while Hurricane Irene followed by Tropical Storm Lee caused severe and unrelenting flooding in the East and Northeastern U.S. Join us on August 1 to learn more about the anatomy of flooding: What are the different causes of these extreme events, and how is USGS science helping prepare residents for future foods.\n<strong>FREE<\/strong> and Open to the Public\nFollow this event <strong>LIVE<\/strong>! @USGSLive\n<strong><\/strong>\n\n<strong>Date<\/strong>: Wednesday, August 1, 2011, 7:00-8:00 PM\n<strong>Location<\/strong>: 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive Reston, VA 20192\n<strong>Phone<\/strong>:\u00c2\u00a0 703-648-4748\nVisit our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public_lecture_series\/\">website<\/a>!\nAbout the Lecture Series\nThe USGS Science in Action public lecture series in Reston, VA is a monthly event.
