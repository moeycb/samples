The <em>Muskie <\/em>will be stationed in Lake Erie, and the <em>Kaho<\/em> will be stationed in Lake Ontario. Both ships are 70.8 ft. in length and have a draft (displacement) of five feet or less. This puts them at the smaller end of the GLSC fleet, which boasts two ships with greater than 100 ft. in length, and one with 75 ft. in length. However, the<em> R\/V<\/em> <em>Kaho<\/em> and <em>R\/V Muskie<\/em>, with their much shallower draft, are able to do research closer to shore, making them ideal for the smaller lakes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe <em>R\/V Muskie <\/em>and the <em>R\/V Kaho<\/em> will provide safe and reliable platforms for scientists, and are equipped with state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation to improve our understanding of deep-water ecosystems and fishes in lakes Erie and Ontario,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Russell Strach, director of the GLSC.\n\nStrach noted that the new vessels will replace the oldest vessels in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/main.php?content=aboutus_theglsc_vessels&amp;title=The%20GLSC0&amp;menu=aboutus\">fleet<\/a> - those on lakes Erie and Ontario - and will have increased fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and greater research capacities, especially because the boats they are replacing functioned on 1950s and 60s technologies.\n\nAdditional improvements in the two ships, such as increased bunk space and shower facilities, allow them to spend more time at sea, enhancing the research capabilities of the GLSC.\n\n<strong>Critical Research<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_172625\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"USGS researchers deploy a beam trawl from the R\/V Kiyi\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/10\/Embedded-Image-3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-172625\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/10\/Embedded-Image-3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nResearchers at the GLSC are eager to use the large vessels to better assess and explore the health and population status of Great Lakes deep-water ecosystems.\u00c2\u00a0 USGS science is critical for federal, state, and tribal resource managers to make decisions that effectively protect the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $7 billion annual commercial and sport fisheries.\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/\">GLSC<\/a> is the only federal center that has a large scientific research vessel stationed on each of the Great Lakes capable of working for extended periods of time in offshore, deep-water areas.\u00c2\u00a0 The research programs facilitated by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/\">GLSC<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fleet, are critical to managing and conserving Great Lakes resources, and are used by Great Lakes state,\u00c2\u00a0 provincial, and tribal management agencies across the basin.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_172624\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"USGS GLSC researchers use their ships to study populations of key predator and preyfish to inform the decisions of resource managers.\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/10\/Embedded-Image-4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-172624\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2011\/10\/Embedded-Image-4-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">USGS<\/a> awarded an $8.2 million contract to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thegreatlakesgroup.com\/\">Great Lakes Towing Company<\/a> (Cleveland, Ohio) in June 2010 for the construction of the two large vessels.\u00c2\u00a0 Funding for the contract came from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recovery.gov\/About\/Pages\/The_Act.aspx\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act<\/a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/\">GLSC<\/a>\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission is to meet the nation's need for scientific information for restoring, enhancing, managing, and protecting living resources and their habitats in the Great Lakes basin ecosystem.\n\nDon't forget, the R\/V Muskie and R\/V Kaho are just two of the GLSC's fleet!\u00c2\u00a0 Meet the rest of them <a href=\"http:\/\/www.glsc.usgs.gov\/main.php?content=aboutus_theglsc_vessels&amp;title=The%20GLSC0&amp;menu=aboutus\">here<\/a>!\n\n<strong>Contact<\/strong>: <a href=\"mailto:hpatrick@usgs.gov\">Holly Patrick<\/a>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["Biology and Ecosystems","fish","Great Lakes","water"],"article_type":["Science Snippet"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1318023985","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
