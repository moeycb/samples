I went down to the school and spoke with the program director where I learned about the great career opportunities the program had to offer, including working as a hydrologic technician for the USGS. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">I was very interested in this opportunity, so I enrolled that same day for the following semester. The USGS came to the college to interview and recruit students for summer internships, and I was fortunate in being recruited for a summer internship as a SCEP at the Redding Field Office in California. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">I completed my summer internship in Redding and was offered the permanent position after completion of the program. I graduated in May of 2011 and was then converted to a permanent position and promoted shortly after.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it like to be a USGS Hydrotech?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">As a hydrological technician, my primary duties involve managing real-time surface water gaging stations. This consists of making monthly gage inspections, stream flow measurements, processing field data, and performing necessary maintenance to ensure the gage is operating properly. This hydrologic data is collated for record computation and analysis, which is provided for the public, sister agencies, and cooperators. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_173102\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"USGS Hydrologic Technician Josh Latimore collects data on the Trinity River\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/Josh-Latimore-on-Trinity-River.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-173102\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/Josh-Latimore-on-Trinity-River-300x154.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Latimore kayaking on Trinity River\" width=\"300\" height=\"154\" \/><\/a>[\/caption]\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your most memorable moment with the USGS?<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">During my time at USGS, one of the most memorable experiences I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had working in the field was during the 2011 peak flow release on the Trinity River, a part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trrp.net\/\">Trinity River Restoration Program<\/a> peak flow releases for the fisheries.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">Why it matters<\/span><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">The Trinity River in northwestern California supports large populations of several different fish species, including salmon and steelhead. Since the late 1950s, 75 to 90 percent of the River\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual flow has been exported for surrounding populations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 water and power needs, and this habitat alteration has resulted in declines of <\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;\">salmon and steelhead populations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;\">Since the 1900s, restorations flows have been introduced in an effort to rehabilitate populations, build gravel\/cobble bars, and provide adequate habitat conditions for different fish species. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif'; color: black; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;\">This year I was able to participate in a high flow release of water on the Trinity River from the Lewiston Dam. This event was <\/span><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">marked as the second highest flow released from Lewiston Dam since 1960, when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usbr.gov\/\">regulations<\/a> began here. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">For several days, our crew made a series of intense boat measurements at the five gaging stations below the Lewiston dam. We started taking measurements at the peak flow and continued measurements as the release of water subsided and the current gradually subsided to its base flow. The vast importance and intensity of this project instilled a memory that I will never forget. <span>\u00c2\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n\n<h3 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/Josh-Latimore-MV-cable1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-173107\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/01\/Josh-Latimore-MV-cable1-214x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? <\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">From here, I will continue to enhance my knowledge and skills working as a hydrologic technician through work experience, a variety of training courses offered around the country, and any new opportunities for advancement that arise along the way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">I am also back in school in pursuit of a bachelor of science degree with the intent of becoming a hydrologist. I am taking courses locally at Shasta College in Redding before I transfer to California State University, Chico, where I plan to graduate in spring of 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">I really believe the USGS is a great place for youth and students to look for a career because it is a well-respected scientific agency that encompasses a variety of career opportunities with room for advancement in the study of water, earth, biological sciences, and mapping.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Times','serif';\">\n<\/span><\/p>\n<iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/K-5KvVL7OQ0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"233\"><\/iframe>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":{"und":[{"fid":"24167","uid":"31","filename":"josh-latimore-usgs.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/josh-latimore-usgs.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"53102","status":"1","timestamp":"1425492768","type":"image","uuid":"cbcbf006-4c5f-40c2-8451-81108b2240bf","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":255,"width":496},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"country":["United States of America"],"article_type":["Featured Story"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1325705480","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":[],"subtitle":[]}
