The virus belongs to a family of viruses that includes rabies. The disease causes internal bleeding in fish, but is not harmful to people. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nWinton and co-authors Gael Kurath and William Batts recently authored a new USGS fact sheet that describes important genetic information about isolates of VHSV from Great Lakes region (see <a href=\"http:\/\/wfrc.usgs.gov\/pubs\/factsheetpdf\/vhsfs2011108.pdf\">Molecular Epidemiology of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus in the Great Lakes Region<\/a> factsheet).Other strains of the VHS virus are found in continental Europe, North Pacific Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea and North Sea. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;&quot;This Great Lakes strain appears to have an exceptionally broad host range,&quot; said Winton. &quot;Significant die-offs have occurred in muskellunge, freshwater drum, yellow perch, round goby, emerald shiners and gizzard shad.&quot; \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nGenetic research at the WFRC and by colleagues from Canada showed that this strain of the virus was probably introduced into the Great Lakes in the last 5 to 10 years, and that the fish die-offs occurring among different species and in different lakes should be considered as one large ongoing epidemic. The USGS genetic research also indicated that the Great Lakes&#39; strain of the virus was not from Europe, where three other strains of the virus occur, but more likely had its origin among marine or estuarine fish of the Atlantic seaboard of North America. The strain is genetically most like samples of VHSV recovered during 2000-2004 from diseased fish in areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Great Lakes&#39; strain has now been isolated from more than 25 species of fish in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Saint Lawrence River and from inland lakes in New York, Michigan and Wisconsin. Experts fear the disease could potentially spread from the Great Lakes into new populations of native fish in the 31 states of the Mississippi River basin. Also, if VHS virus is introduced into the aquaculture industry, it could lead to trade restrictions as well as direct losses from the disease. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nRegulatory agencies in the United States and Canada have already placed restrictions on the movement of fish or fish products that could pose a risk for the spread of VHS virus to regions outside of the known geographic range. These restrictions include requirements for viral examinations by standard methods. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor information on how to detect and confirm VHS virus, see <a href=\"http:\/\/biology.usgs.gov\/faer\/\">Fisheries: Aquatic and Endangered Resources Program<\/a>.\r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York","Pennsylvania","Illinois","Indiana","Michigan","Minnesota","Ohio","Wisconsin"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1201064400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169017"},{"tid":"169671"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
