Larsen, USGS Associate Director for Water. &ldquo;Findings assist water utility managers and regulators in making decisions about future monitoring needs and drinking-water issues.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Findings showed that naturally occurring contaminants, such as radon and arsenic, accounted for about three-quarters of contaminant concentrations greater than human-health benchmarks in untreated source water. Naturally occurring contaminants are mostly derived from the natural geologic materials that make up the aquifers from which well water is withdrawn.<\/p>\r\n<p>Man-made contaminants were also found in untreated water sampled from the public wells, including herbicides, insecticides, solvents, disinfection by-products, nitrate, and gasoline chemicals. Man-made contaminants accounted for about one-quarter of contaminant concentrations greater than human-health benchmarks, but were detected in 64 percent of the samples, predominantly in samples from unconfined aquifers.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Detections of contaminants do not necessarily indicate a concern for human health because USGS analytical methods can detect many contaminants at concentrations that are 100-fold to 1,000-fold lower than human-health benchmarks,&rdquo; said lead scientist Patricia Toccalino. &ldquo;Assessing contaminants in these small amounts helps to track emerging issues in our water resources and to identify contaminants that may warrant inclusion in future monitoring.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists tested water samples for 337 properties and chemical contaminants, including nutrients, radionuclides, trace elements, pesticides, solvents, gasoline hydrocarbo","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["contaminants","groundwater","publicwells","waterquality","humanhealth","water","Core Cast"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1274414400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169801"},{"tid":"170225"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
