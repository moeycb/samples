In low streamflow conditions, groundwater sources take a larger role.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In this study, USGS scientists closely examined surface and ground waters at seven study sites from across the nation to determine the portion of stream nitrate derived from groundwater. They found that most of the nitrate observed in streams located in groundwater-dominated watersheds was derived from groundwater sources. To determine the time it takes groundwater to reach a stream in a groundwater-dominated watershed, an age dating tracer study was conducted in the Tomorrow River in central Wisconsin. The findings indicated that decades-old nitrate-laden water was currently discharging to this stream. Consequently, base flow nitrate concentrations in this stream may be sustained for decades to come, regardless of current and future practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The slow release of groundwater nitrate to streams may also affect the water quality of large rivers. For example, increases in nitrate concentrations during low and moderate flows in large rivers in the Mississippi River Basin have been observed to be greater than or comparable to increases in nitrate concentrations during high flows. (See USGS website, <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nawqa\/pubs\/nitrate_trends\/\">Nitrate in the Mississippi River and its tributaries, 1980 to 2008<\/a>.) These findings also suggest that increasing nitrate concentrations in groundwater are having a substantial effect on nitrate concentrations in rivers and nitrate transport to the Gulf of Mexico. Because nitrate moves slowly through groundwater to rivers, the full effect of management strategies designed to reduce nitrate movement to these rivers may not be seen for many years.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Citation&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>\"Vulnerability of Streams to Legacy Nitrate Sources\"<br \/>Anthony J.
