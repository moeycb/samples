The highest flow, 18 bgd, occurred on Nov. 16 and the lowest flow, 2.3 bgd, was on Nov. 10. \r\n<p>ON THURS., DEC. 7, 1995, AT 2 P.M., FLOW OF THE POTOMAC RIVER NEAR THE DISTRICT WAS ABOUT 5.9 BGD, FIVE PERCENT BELOW THE DECEMBER AVERAGE FLOW OF 6.2 BGD. \r\n<p>Combined freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake Bay from the Susquehanna River, the Potomac River and the James River was well above normal for the second consecutive month, at about 51.7 bgd, 38 percent higher than the November average inflow of 37.5 bgd. \r\n<p>Ground-water levels around Washington, D.C., rose in November but are still slightly below normal for the 15th consecutive month.
