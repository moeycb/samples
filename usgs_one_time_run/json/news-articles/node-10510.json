The web site provides the public a tool to compare current or possible flood conditions with past historical flood information by state and year, as to magnitude, cause, loss of life, damage, and cost for this 28-year time period.<\/p>\n<p>For more than 125 years, the USGS has played a critical role in reducing flood losses through scientific research and, most importantly, by operating the national streamgaging network of more than 7,000 gaging stations that provide real-time information to emergency responders and long-term data to flood-plain managers. These components work together to provide the information -- before, during, and after each flood -- to manage flood risks today and expand our understanding of flood processes and characteristics to save lives and property tomorrow. The National Weather Service relies upon long-term flow records to develop models that are used with the real-time streamflow data to issue flood warnings that are vital for flood damage prevention and public safety. Real-time streamflow information is accessible at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Flood information is also available on WaterWatch, a USGS web site that displays maps, graphs, and tables describing current, recent, and past streamflow conditions for the U.S. WaterWatch summarizes flow conditions to include recent and historical peaks for rivers and streams throughout the nation and also depicts and quantifies the severity and spatial extent of hydrologic hazards, including floods and droughts.
