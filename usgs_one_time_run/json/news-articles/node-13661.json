From 1998-2005 the City has invested in eliminating taste and odor problems in the drinking water, which can be attributed to high levels of nutrients causing algal biomass in the water.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"It is a great service to communities when USGS monitoring of water quality demonstrates whether changes in management practices are having any impact on nitrogen and phosphorous levels in public water supplies,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"And it is a cause for celebration when that monitoring confirms that indeed those actions are having the intended beneficial effect.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus measured in 2010 were less than those typically recorded in from 2002&ndash;2009. USGS scientists tested for nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment at five streamflow-gaging stations in the Spavinaw and Beaty Creek basins in the Eucha-Spavinaw basin of northwestern Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma.
