Coal tar, which can cause cancer in humans, is made up of more than 50 percent PAHs. An estimated 85 million gallons of coal-tar-based sealant are used on parking lots and driveways each year, primarily in the central and eastern United States.\n\n<strong>What<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>are<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>the<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>rates<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>of<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>PAH<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>emissions<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>to<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>the<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>air<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>from<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>coal-tar-based<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>sealcoat?<\/strong>\n\nCoal-tar-based sealants are emitting PAHs into the air at rates that could be greater than annual emissions from vehicles in the United States based on a study in which USGS scientists tracked PAH levels in air and in dried sealcoat following sealcoat application to a parking lot. Two hours after sealcoat application, PAH emissions were 30,000 times higher than those from unsealed pavement. In a second study, USGS scientists measured PAHs in air above parking lots with and without sealcoat, in suburban Austin, Texas. Parking lots with three- to eight-year-old sealant still released 60 times more PAHs to the air than parking lots without sealant.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"232\" caption=\"A USGS scientist adjusts an air pump used to measure emission of polycyclic aromatic carbons (PAHs) into the air.\"]<img class=\" \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/02_08_2012\/t85Bs11RQl_02_08_2012\/medium\/ParkingLot93-1.jpg\" alt=\"An image of a USGS scientist as she adjusts an air pump used to measure emission of polycyclic aromatic carbons (PAHs) into the air.\" width=\"232\" height=\"350\" \/>[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Children<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>living<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>near<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>sealed<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>parking<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>lots<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>are<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>exposed<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>to<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>PAHs<\/strong>\n\nChildren living near coal-tar-sealed pavement are exposed to twice as many PAHs from ingestion of contaminated house dust than from food, according to a separate new study by Baylor University and the USGS. Baylor University scientist Spencer Williams used USGS measurements of PAHs in house dust to estimate the potential ingestion of PAHs by young children living near coal-tar-sealed parking lots. Ingestion of PAHs from food has long been thought to be the primary route by which children are exposed to PAHs. PAH ingestion by children living near coal-tar-sealed parking lots\u00c2\u00a0 is estimated to be 14 times higher than by children in apartments adjacent to unsealed parking lots.\n\n<strong>Sealcoat<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>is<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>a<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>major<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>source<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>of<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>PAHs<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>to<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>the<\/strong><strong> <\/strong><strong>environment<\/strong>\n\nPast and current\u00c2\u00a0 research on environmental contamination and coal-tar-based pavement sealants and implications for human health and stormwater management are summarized in a new Feature Article in the journal <em>Environmental<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Science<\/em><em> <\/em><em>and<\/em><em> <\/em><em>Technology<\/em>.
