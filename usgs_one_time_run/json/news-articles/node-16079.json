The USGS, in concert with our partners, is providing scientific assessments of the challenges wrought by Isaac.\n\n<strong>Storm-Surge and Real-Time Sensors<\/strong>\n\nThe USGS has deployed more than\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/50.17.205.92\/Apps\/IsaacStormSurgeMapper\/IsaacStormSurgeMapper.html\" target=\"_blank\">120 storm-surge sensors<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0along the northern Gulf of Mexico in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Of those sensors, 12 are reporting data in real-time, while the other sensors will be collected post-landfall.\n\nThe instruments will be removed as soon as possible, following the departure of the storm.\n\nThese sensors are typically about 1 1\/2 inches wide and a foot long, and will be strapped to piers, docks or other structures in the water expected to withstand the storm to collect data on storm surge, and in some cases, transmit water levels in real time.\u00c2\u00a0 They are typically installed on the coast or just inland of the coast about 50 miles west and 100 miles east of the projected landfall area.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Learn more\u00c2\u00a0about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/usgs_science_pick\/usgs-storm-surge-sensors\/\" target=\"_blank\">our storm surge sensors<\/a> and what to do if you see one.\n\n<strong>Coastal Change Impacts<\/strong>\n\nElevated water levels and waves during tropical storms can lead to dramatic coastal change through erosion of beaches and dunes. USGS has developed a storm-impact scale that predicts the likelihood of coastal change by comparing modeled elevations of\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/impact-scale\/water-level.php\">storm-induced water levels<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0to known elevations of coastal topography in order to define\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/coastal.er.usgs.gov\/hurricanes\/impact-scale\/\">three coastal change regimes<\/a>.
