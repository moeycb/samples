The plane will collect measurements from the areas surrounding and including the city of Wenatchee, Stevens Pass, parts of Chelan, Douglas, and Grant Counties, and the towns of Chelan and Entiat.<\/p>\r\n<p>This scientific analysis is designed to remotely study geologic and hydrologic features that lie below the land surface. It is part of an ongoing USGS federal research program to identify physical occurrences such as changes in rock types. The program&rsquo;s goal is to provide a better understanding of the geology and hydrology of the region via an aerial perspective. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The plane is operated by Firefly Aviation Ltd., of Calgary, Canada under contract to the USGS and is controlled by experienced pilots who are specially trained for low-level flying.
