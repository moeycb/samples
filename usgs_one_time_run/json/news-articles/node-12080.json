Kawili Street, Hilo. A map of the campus is <a href=\"http:\/\/hilo.hawaii.edu\/images\/maps\/main_campus_map.pdf\">online<\/a>&nbsp;(PDF).<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1790, many people died during Kilauea Volcano's largest explosive eruption in 1,000 years. What happened during that eruption?&nbsp; Why were there fatalities? Swanson has spent 10 years of field work on Kilauea to find the answers to these questions.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Swanson, his findings provide a sketch of what can be expected during Kilauea's next violent explosive eruption, and \"the picture isn't pretty.\"&nbsp; He will share what he and his colleagues have learned about Kilauea's 1790 eruption in his presentation.<\/p>\r\n<p>The start of the 1790 eruption remains enigmatic, but Swanson's ongoing research indicates that the eruption had several violent stages, all of which were potentially deadly. This conclusion is based on&nbsp;&nbsp; his extensive investigation of volcanic deposits produced by the explosive events. Swanson says these layered geologic deposits can be \"read\" like chapters in a book to reveal the story of the eruption.<\/p>\r\n<p>This presentation is one of many programs offered by HVO during Hawai`i Island's second annual Volcano Awareness Month (January 2011).
