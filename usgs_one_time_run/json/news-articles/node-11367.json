Most other fish\r\npopulations in this area have been wiped out over the past 20 years due to\r\ndrought and flood conditions.<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"220\" align=\"right\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-1-9\/trout.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/images\/2008-1-9\/trout_tn.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Read caption below\" \/><\/a><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"small\">Pictured here is a southern steelhead from Devil Canyon Creek, a tributary to San Mateo Creek, at the southern end of the Santa Ana Mountains.

If the trout survived the dry ravel, the next impact could be\r\nwhen rain mixes with the dry ravel, and the mixture begins to move. This\r\nmixture could fill in the creek systems in the canyon and remove the rest of\r\nthe water sources, Fisher said.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the podcast, Fisher also describes how scientists captured\r\nendangered mountain-yellow legged frog tadpoles before post-fire and drought\r\nconditions depleted their population and are housing them until they grow into\r\nadults. Scientists want to release the adult frogs into the wild when\r\nconditions are suitable.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We are hopeful that the resea","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1199854800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169087"},{"tid":"169442"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
