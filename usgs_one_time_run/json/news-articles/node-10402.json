The flow of the Hudson River at Hadley, N.Y., continues to decline. On Fri., Aug. 25, the flow was 230 million gallons per day (mgd), 70 percent percent less than the long-term average August flow of 773 mgd. \n<p>The salt front in the Hudson River near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., continues to advance, due in part to decreased inflow from the upper Hudson. On Wed., Aug. 23, the salt front was about 4.9 miles away from the intakes for Poughkeepsie&rsquo;s water supply. \r\n<p>In Pennsylvania, the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg (Thurs., Aug. 24) was a below-normal 2.5 billion gallons per day (bgd), 66 percent below the August average flow of 7.4 bgd. \r\n<p>In the Delaware River basin, total storage in the Pepacton, Cannonsville, and Neversink reservoirs continues to decline.. On Fri., Aug. 25, storage in the reservoirs was about 155 billion gallons, about 13 billion gallons above the drought-warning level, and 63 billion gallons less than on July 5, when voluntary water conservation measures were called for by New York City and Westchester County water managers. \r\n<p>The Delaware basin reservoirs supply about half of New York City&rsquo;s water supply as well as other municipalities in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. \r\n<p>According to a 1954 Supreme Court decree, the Delaware River Master is empowered to limit diversions of water from the Delaware River basin, with stricter controls in time of drought. \r\n<p>For more information on the nation&rsquo;s water resources from the USGS, call EarthFax, the new fax-on-demand system at (703) 648-4888 and press 3. \r\n<p>(Note to Editors: For additional water information, reporters may call Grady Moore in Albany, New York, at 518-285-5600 or Gary Paulachok in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, at 717-730-6900.)<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York","Pennsylvania"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"809323200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170308"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
