The fish may also be attacked by native predators, such as larger fish, fish-eating birds, or water snakes. <\/p>\r\n<p>If exotic fish survive and reproduce, they are difficult, if not impossible, to control or eradicate. Their presence may lead to changes in the native, or local, fish population in an area through competition with native species or by preying on them. <\/p>\r\n<p>Just as aquarium fish that are dumped into the nearest stream may become susceptible to unfamiliar parasites and diseases, they may also infect native fish with exotic parasites or diseases. And, aquarium fishes may affect the genetics of native species by hybridizing with them. <\/p>\r\n<p>Some aquarium species may even pose a physical or public health threat, such as piranhas and freshwater stingrays.What is the right way to dispose of your aquarium fishes? Fuller makes the following suggestions:<br>Return the fish to a local pet shop for resale or trade.<br>Give them away, to another hobbyist, an aquarium in a professional office, a museum, a public aquarium or zoological park.<br>Donate them to a public institution, such as a school, nursing home, hospital, or prison. <\/p>\r\n<p>To find out more about invasive species in general, go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov<\/a> and click on \"Invasive Species Threaten America&rsquo;s Biological Heritage.\" or go directly to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/invasive_species\/plw\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/invasive_species\/plw\/index.html<\/a>.
