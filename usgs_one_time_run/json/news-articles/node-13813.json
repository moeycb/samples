The sensors were installed to measure the storm-tide height and intensity of Hurricane Isaac.&nbsp; The information will help define the depth and duration of the storm-tide, as well as the time of its arrival and retreat. That information will help assess storm damage, discern between wind and flood damage, and improve computer models used to forecast future floods.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As Isaac moves inland, flooding from the drenching rains becomes an issue, and as the storm &nbsp;progresses northward, additional measurements will be required in the Midwest states.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What<\/strong>: Reporters can accompany the USGS crews as they retrieve the storm-tide sensors, measure high water marks, and collect water samples from various locations along the Gulf Coast. USGS crews will also be making flood measurements at affected streamgages inland from the coast that are critical for accurate flood forecasts.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Points of Contact<\/strong>:<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"1220\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"240\">\r\n<p>&nbsp; &bull; Louisiana:<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>George Arcement<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"800\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;(225) 978-4203<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"240\">\r\n<p>&nbsp; &bull; Mississippi<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Michael Plunkett<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"800\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;(601) 933-2940<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"240\">\r\n<p>&nbsp; &bull; Alabama:<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"170\">\r\n<p>Athena Clark &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<td width=\"800\">\r\n<p>&nbsp;(334) 395-4141<\/p>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p><strong>When\/Where<\/strong>: The specific schedules and locations will vary by state depending on flooding and road closures.
