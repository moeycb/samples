Statistical methods are used to incorporate uncertainty and natural geologic variability on the ranges of possible storage resources within a storage assessment unit.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>This research benefited from discussions with a variety of partners and stakeholders, such as the Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory, State Geological Surveys, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Bureau of Land Management.&nbsp; The USGS will accept technical comments on the methodology from the public in the near future.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS is conducting research on a number of fronts related to carbon sequestration. These efforts include evaluation of potential biological sequestration in a variety of ecosystems, potential release of greenhouse gases from Arctic soils and permafrost, mapping the distribution of ultramafic rocks for potential mineral sequestration efforts, and the possible role of gas hydrates in carbon sequestration.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information about USGS geologic carbon sequestration efforts and to learn more about this new methodology, visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/energy.usgs.gov\">USGS Energy Resources Program Web site<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["geology","Climate Change","carbon","Carbon Dioxide","energy"],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1237176000","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169682"},{"tid":"169633"},{"tid":"169956"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
