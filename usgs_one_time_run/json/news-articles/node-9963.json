During the cruise, scientists from the USGS will discharge small air guns that are towed behind the ship, and display images of the seafloor and sub-surface as they are compiled from the digital recordings of reflected sound waves. \r\n<p>The two-three-hour cruise will allow plenty of time for reporters to acquire still and video footage and to interview the participating scientists and technicians. The ship will return to Chinook Landing at approximately noon. \r\n<p>Reservations for the demonstration cruise are not necessary, but all reporters and photographers should be at the Chinook marina by 9 a.m., and should be prepared to spend a maximum of three hours on board ship. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"867124800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
