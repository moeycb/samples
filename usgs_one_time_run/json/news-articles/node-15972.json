Many communities in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and Iowa are dealing with record floodwaters and bracing for more flooding in the upcoming weeks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This latest round of flooding is due to extreme spring precipitation, which could be compounded by snowmelt in the mountains in the near future. Though the Missouri River flows into the Mississippi River, flooding on the Missouri River is not expected to significantly affect current flooding on the Mississippi River.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">USGS measurements are the cornerstone of National Weather Service predictions and forecasts. When flooding happens, USGS field crews are among the first to respond. During and after storms and floods, USGS field crews measure the streamflow and height of rivers. Crews repair and install streamgages to ensure the accurate and reliable data continues to make it to USGS partners like the National Weather Service and Army Corps of Engineers, as well as the public, emergency managers and communities.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can keep yourself updated about water levels for the rivers and streams near you by signing up for USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/wateralert\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">WaterAlert<\/span><\/a>, where you can receive instant customized updates about water conditions at any of the thousands of sites nationwide where the USGS collects real-time water information. When you sign up for WaterAlert, you can customize the alert so that you receive notification when water exceeds any preset threshold or goes above the flood stage at your selected streamgage.
