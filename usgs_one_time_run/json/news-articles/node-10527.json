Bedrock aquifer wells -- often known \r\nas rock, deep, or artesian wells -- are the most common type of well installed \r\nfor homes in the region and it is the bedrock aquifer that is the primary source \r\nof arsenic in the locations where it is elevated, according to the findings. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Our study shows where the highest probability of having arsenic in wells \r\noccurs,\" USGS hydrologist Joseph Ayotte said. \"We knew from previous studies \r\nthat arsenic is a regional problem in New England. The information is intended \r\nto assist planners and health officials. It is also intended to help owners in \r\ndeciding whether to test their well.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The study, published in the journal <i>Environmental Science and \r\nTechnology<\/i>, identifies factors that may contribute to high arsenic in wells, \r\nand confirms findings from previous studies.<\/p>\r\n<p>Private wells supply drinking water for over 40 percent of the population of \r\nnorthern New England (20 percent of all of New England) and are not regulated by \r\nstate and Federal agencies. Officials recommend that all private well users test \r\ntheir wells for arsenic. <\/p>\r\n<p>The collaborative study between the USGS, the National Cancer Institute, part \r\nof the National Institutes of Health, Dartmouth Medical School, and the \r\ndepartments of health in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, \r\nconcluded that geology was the most significant factor related to arsenic in \r\nwells. Other factors include the chemistry of the ground water and \r\ncharacteristics of local aquifers. <\/p>\r\n<p>The current Federal standard for arsenic in public water supplies is 10 \r\nmicrograms per liter. In New England, 12 percent of the area studied has a \r\ngreater than 50 percent chance of having wells with arsenic concentrations above \r\n5 micrograms per liter. Nearly one-quarter of the combined area studied in Maine \r\nand New Hampshire has a greater than 50 percent chance of having wells with \r\narsenic at or above 5 micrograms per liter. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Arsenic in ground water used for private or a public water supply is a \r\nsignificant public health concern,\" said Robert W. Varney, regional \r\nadministrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#039;s (EPA) New England \r\noffice. \"To protect families, EPA recommends that private well owners routinely \r\ntest their drinking water for arsenic. As of January 2006, public water \r\nsuppliers are required to meet a new drinking water standard of 10 micrograms \r\nper liter.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Arsenic is probably better known as causing acute illness at higher doses. \r\nBut health effects from long-term exposure at low levels, such as those found in \r\nthis study, are unclear.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Ayotte, this new study is consistent with other, recent studies \r\nthat have suggested that arsenic is predominantly naturally occurring and \r\nrelated to the geology of the area. \"Although human sources may contribute \r\narsenic to ground water, our results suggest that arsenic used as an \r\nagricultural pesticide over the past century is not a major source of arsenic in \r\nground water today,\" Ayotte said. <\/p>\r\n<p>The complete findings, released in the journal Environmental Science and \r\nTechnology, are available at http:\/\/nh.water.usgs.gov <\/p>\r\n<p>Health Information Summaries on arsenic can be found on State and Federal web \r\nsites at: <\/p><b>\r\n<p>New Hampshire:<\/p><\/b>\r\n<p><a \r\nhref=\"http:\/\/www.des.state.nh.us\/factsheets\/ehp\/ard-ehp-1.htm\">http:\/\/www.des.state.nh.us\/factsheets\/ehp\/ard-ehp-1.htm<\/a><\/p><b>\r\n<p>M","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maine","Massachusetts","New Hampshire","Vermont"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1148529600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169219"},{"tid":"169767"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
