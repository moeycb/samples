This popular ornamental, still sold in Virginia nurseries and found in all 48 lower states except Florida, can produce more than 2.5 million seeds per plant annually, making it a prolific nuisance in North America. Through its example in removing this attractive but harmful plant, the USGS hopes to educate the local community in how invasive species affect the nation&rsquo;s natural resources and how gardeners can help prevent their introduction and spread. \r\n<p><b>Visuals:<\/b> Reproducible photos for this release may be found at: \r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife1.tif\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife1.tif<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife2.tif\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife2.tif<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife3.tif\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/loosestrife\/loosestrife3.tif<\/a><br>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Directions:<\/b> The U.S. Geological Survey Headquarters is accessible from the Beltway (I-495).
