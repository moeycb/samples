Fundamental information on how much freshwater is available from streams, rivers, or aquifers, and whether that supply of freshwater is increasing or decreasing, is essential for the Nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic and environmental health. Business and community leaders, farmers, wildlife managers, urban planners, homeowners, and people who use water for recreation all need very specific information about water for many different purposes.\n\nBeyond its necessity and practical use, water on Tribal lands often has an added significance for its place in a Tribe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cultural heritage.\n\n<strong>Water Data for Tribes<\/strong>\n\nTribal lands are home to an extensive\u00c2\u00a0network of USGS streamflow gages and groundwater monitoring stations. Coupled with quantitative models and scientific research, this monitoring network provides objective data and information that can be used by the Tribes to address vital issues such water rights, water supply, flood-warning predictions, contamination, and sustainability of critical habitats and healthy ecosystems.\n\nSome Tribes depend on USGS water science for Tribal sustenance and sovereignty. Ms. Sharri Venno, Environmental Planner with the Houlton Band Maliseet Indians in Houlton, Maine, explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur Tribe relies on USGS streamflow gaging activities to maintain aquatic habitats conducive to native medicinal flora that are of great importance to our Tribal lifestyle and longstanding tribal ceremonies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189881\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"310\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-2-Meduxnekegg-River.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-189881 \" title=\"Figure 2 Meduxnekegg River\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-2-Meduxnekegg-River.jpg\" alt=\"USGS streamgaging on the Meduxnekeag River in eastern Maine helps the Houlton Band Maliseet Indians manage and restore native fish habitats, such as for spawning Atlantic Salmon.

This information is critical for preserving native fish habitat. One native species the Tribe hopes to restore to healthy populations is the Atlantic salmon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n<strong>USGS monitoring, assessments, and research with Tribes in your state\n(<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/coop\/\"><strong>Look up your state<\/strong><\/a><strong>) \u00c2\u00a0<\/strong>\n\nUSGS coordinated efforts with Tribes span a wide variety of activities: for instance, monitoring, training, data management, geographic information systems (GIS), quality control, development of models, and scientific research on ecology, water quantity, and quality.\n\n<strong>Moving Upstream in Washington<\/strong>\n\nIn the State of Washington, for example, cooperative monitoring, assessments, and research with more than 20 Tribes has led to water science and habitat restoration for threatened salmon species and other fish.\n\nThe USGS worked with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yakamanation-nsn.gov\/\">Yakama Nation<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecy.wa.gov\/\">Washington State Department of Ecology<\/a>, and the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usbr.gov\/\">Bureau of Reclamation<\/a> to create <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.usgs.gov\/sir\/2011\/5155\/\">a comprehensive model<\/a> for the entire Yakima River Basin that simulates the\u00c2\u00a0groundwater system and its interaction with rivers and streams.\n\nTom Ring with the Yakama Nation spoke of the importance of this work to the Yakama People.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cSalmon from the Yakima River have sustained the economy, diet and culture of the Yakama People since Time Immemorial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he noted. Ring also highlighted the importance of sustained flows in the Yakima River Basin since the Yakama Nation Treaty Right for instream flow is the senior water right in the basin.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189891\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"418\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-3-Salmon-Jumping.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-189891\" title=\"Figure 3 Salmon Jumping\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-3-Salmon-Jumping.jpg\" alt=\"Salmon jumping ladders at Wapato Diversion dam in Yakima, Washington.

These efforts serve water resource needs within Tribal Nation jurisdictional boundaries and help to support the information needs identified in the Oklahoma Water Resources Board\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recently completed State Water Plan.\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009cState of the Science\u00e2\u0080\u009d effort with the Osage Nation, begun in July 2013, employs the latest advancements in USGS technology to assess water types (i.e. fresh and saline) and help quantify connections between water supply and demand. The study incorporates conventional hydrologic data gathering along with the latest advanced technology for water studies: high-resolution aerial geophysical surveys, real-time surface water\/groundwater interaction monitoring sites, aquifer yield assessment wells, and the development of a geologic framework model. Ultimately, an integrated three-dimensional surface-water\/groundwater model will be developed to analyze critical changes in the several hydrologic regions of the Osage under different climate and water-use scenarios. The study results will provide a versatile and reliable knowledge base so that the Osage Nation and their partners can plan for sustained water resources now and into the future.\n\n<strong>Arizona Waters and Tribal Lands<\/strong>\n\nUSGS in Arizona works with 10 of the 19 federally recognized Tribal governments to investigate such topics as water rights, water use, hydrologic conditions, and water-quality issues. <a href=\"http:\/\/az.water.usgs.gov\/projects\/tribal_programs\/index.html\">\u00c2\u00a0Summary of USGS Tribal programs in Arizona<\/a>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_189901\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"430\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-4-White-Mountain-Apache.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-189901 \" title=\"Figure 4 White Mountain Apache\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/01\/Figure-4-White-Mountain-Apache.jpg\" alt=\"USGS and the Navajo Nation performed a &quot;channel geometry&quot; survey near Lukachukai, Arizona to help the Tribe improve indirect measurments of stream.
