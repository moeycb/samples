The NC CSC is a partnership involving the Department and nine universities, led by Colorado State University.<\/p>\r\n<p>The national network of regional Climate Science Centers will provide land managers in federal, state and local agencies access to the best science available regarding climate change and other landscape-scale stressors impacting the nation's natural and cultural resources.&nbsp;The new centers will be managed by the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center located at the U.S. Geological Survey's headquarters in Reston, Va.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We have been utterly blown away by the quality of the proposals submitted by the consortia of universities competing to be selected as each of the eight regional DOI Climate Science Centers, and thus it is no surprise that the credentials of those seeking to lead these centers have been equally outstanding,\" said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. \"With the Rocky Mountains already at the leading edge of many climate-related challenges, such as pine-bark beetle infestation, the breadth and depth of Dr. Morisette's background is a great match to the challenges ahead.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Previously, Morisette served collaterally as the Assistant Center Director for Science and Head of the Invasive Species Science Branch Center at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center. He first joined the USGS in 2008 and has conducted applied research in earth sciences with an emphasis in habitat modeling and land surface phenology.<\/p>\r\n<p>Morisette formerly worked for NASA as a physical scientist. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Siena Heights College, a master's in applied statistics from Oakland University, and a doctorate in philosophy\/forestry and remote sensing from North Carolina State University.
