In areas of modest uplift and erosion, gas that was dissolved in oil came out of solution, forming gas caps and displacing oil downward into poorer quality reservoir rocks. In areas where uplift and erosion were significant, the gas present in the subsurface expanded so much that it completely displaced oil from reservoirs. The variable nature of the uplift and erosion resulted in some reservoirs retaining their oil, but the majority of the reservoirs instead became gas bearing.<\/p>\r\n<p>NPRA has been the focus of significan","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alaska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["energy","oil","Alaska","npra","naturalgas","BLM"],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1288065600","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168806"},{"tid":"168962"},{"tid":"169164"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
