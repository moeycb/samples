These data are used to develop flood forecasts, to manage flood control and coordinate flood response activities, to manage water supplies and droughts, to keep our waters clean, and to provide information for many recreational activities.<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Contacts<\/span>:<\/p>\r\n<p>National Flood Specialist: Robert Holmes, 573-308-3581, bholmes@usgs.gov.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you would like to know more specific information about USGS Tropical Storm Hanna response activities in your area, please contact the appropriate person listed below.<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Delaware, Holly Weyers, 302-734-2506 (ext. 224), <a href=\"mailto:hsweyers@usgs.gov\">hsweyers@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Florida, Barry Rosen, 407-803-5508, <a href=\"mailto:brosen@usgs.gov\">brosen@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Georgia, Brian McCallum, 404-375-2505, <a href=\"mailto:bemccall@usgs.gov\">bemccall@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Maryland, Ed Doheny, 443-498-5535, <a href=\"mailto:ejdoheny@usgs.gov\">ejdoheny@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>North Carolina, Jerad Bales, 919-571-4048, <a href=\"mailto:jdbales@usgs.gov\">jdbales@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>South Carolina, Eric Strom, 803-750-6109, <a href=\"mailto:ewstrom@usgs.gov\">ewstrom@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li>Virginia, Mark Bennett, 804-261-2643, <a href=\"mailto:mrbennet@usgs.gov\">mrbennet@usgs.gov<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Delaware","Maryland","Virginia","Florida","Georgia","North Carolina","South Carolina"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":["water","Hanna","High Flow","coastal","Coastal Change","environment","flooding","floods","hazards","hurricanes","streamflow","streamgages","Streams","water","Tropical Storm"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1220587200","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168777"},{"tid":"169606"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
