As of today, New York City&rsquo;s allowable diversion amount is reduced from 680 million gallons per day (mgd) to 560 mgd. \r\n<p>New Jersey&rsquo;s allowable diversion amount is reduced from 85 mgd to 70 mgd. \r\n<p>Flow of the Delaware River continues to decline. Today&rsquo;s flow of 930 mgd is 38 percent less than the average flow of 1490 mgd on Oct. 13, at the USGS streamgauge at Montague, N.J. \r\n<p>Restrictions on out-of-basin transfers of water and releases from the Delaware River reservoirs allow reservoir storage to be maintained at acceptable levels and flow of the river to be kept at or above approved minimums. Under a 1954 Supreme Court decree, the Delaware River Master is empowered to limit diversions of water from the Delaware River basin, with stricter controls during times of drought.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Delaware","New Jersey","New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"813556800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170308"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
