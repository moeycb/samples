And while a longer growing season can result in increased yields for some crops, it is risky because of the higher likelihood of plant damage due to late frosts or later onset of drought. For example, in spring 2012, fruit and vegetable crops in portions of the Midwest were damaged from a very early spring followed by frosts.\n\n<strong>Phenology, the Study of Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Calendar<\/strong>\n\nThe study of when recurring seasonal life stages of plants and animals occur is called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usanpn.org\/about\/why-phenology\">phenology<\/a>, and people have tracked phenology for centuries for the most practical of reasons: when to hunt and fish, when to plant and harvest crops, and when to move livestock or animal herds.\n\nTracking phenology is just as critical today for the same reasons and for new ones too.\u00c2\u00a0 Not only are the data in <em>Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Notebook <\/em>helping researchers understand how plants and animals are responding to climate change, but also how those responses are affecting people and ecological systems. This information is already being used in ways that benefit society, including developing more accurate indicators of spring, forecasting the onset of allergy season or the chances of western wildfires, managing wildlife and invasive plants, and helping in habitat-restoration efforts.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"194\"]<img class=\"  \" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/03_02_2009\/c2WJb44ay7_03_02_2009\/medium\/Arizona_Saguaro_Jun_1979_001.jpg\" alt=\"Green buds on a saguaro cactus begin to bloom\" width=\"194\" height=\"280\" \/> Arizona saquaro will be one of the species looked at by USA-NPN volunteers.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>Is Climate Change Knocking Nature Out of Sync?<\/strong>\n\nChanges in phenology are among the most sensitive biological indicators of local, regional and global change. Just as in the United States, many springtime events around the world are occurring earlier \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and fall events happening later \u00e2\u0080\u0094 than in the past. These changes are happening quickly for some species and more slowly, or not at all, for others, altering relationships and processes that may have been essentially stable for thousands of years.\n\nSome wildlife \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like caribou and butterflies and hummingbirds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are becoming mismatched from their plant food resources, which are responding differently.\u00c2\u00a0 Migrations for some birds are changing too, as they can now overwinter instead of moving south for the winter, or as they fly north, adjusting their pace to keep up with an advancing front of spring flowering.\n\n<strong>Phenology, Pollinators, and Food<\/strong>\n\nWorking farms and ranches need phenology information too:\u00c2\u00a0 pollination by native insects contributes more than $3 billion in agricultural crops each year. Climate-driven changes in the phenology of crops and native insects could change the effectiveness of insect pollination for better or for worse, and certainly complicates management decisions. \u00c2\u00a0However, because little is known about how pollinator phenology is changing, it is difficult to accurately assess how crops will be affected and how farmers might best adapt. By collecting observations of insect phenology and crop phenology together, the USA-NPN is contributing to our understanding of the changes taking place and helping to ensure the viability of crops across the country.\n\n<strong>Where You Come In<\/strong>\n\nIn three simple steps, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usanpn.org\/nn\/become-observer\">become a citizen scientist<\/a>: 1.
