Landslide\u00c2\u00a0debris covered about 30 houses and 0.8 miles of State Route 530.\n<h2>What Happened<\/h2>\nThe landslide occurred in an area of known landslide activity,\u00c2\u00a0but this time the slide was much larger, traveled much further, and had\u00c2\u00a0greater destructive force than previously experienced. Precipitation in the\u00c2\u00a0area in February and March was 150 to 200% of the long-term average, and likely\u00c2\u00a0contributed to landslide initiation.\n\nThe slide took place along the edge of a plateau about 600 feet\u00c2\u00a0high composed of glacial sediments. The volume of the slide is estimated to be\u00c2\u00a0about 10 million cubic yards, and it traveled about 0.7 miles from the toe of\u00c2\u00a0the slope. This travel distance is about three times longer than expected based\u00c2\u00a0on published information regarding previous slides of this height and volume worldwide. If the landslide had behaved in the expected range, it would have\u00c2\u00a0likely blocked the river and possibly destroyed a few houses. Instead it led to\u00c2\u00a0tragic loss of life and destruction of property.\n\nFlow also dammed and temporarily blocked the upper part of the North\u00c2\u00a0Fork Stillaguamish River. A pool of water formed behind the debris dam, which\u00c2\u00a0flooded houses and other structures. There were initial fears that the debris\u00c2\u00a0dam would create a flood hazard downstream if the dam were breached, but a\u00c2\u00a0catastrophic dam breach is now considered unlikely. Currently, the lake level is gradually decreasing as the river is cutting a new channel across the top of\u00c2\u00a0the debris dam.\n\nUSGS scientists are supporting state and county agencies\u00c2\u00a0responding to the event. It is a collaborative effort, with many working hard\u00c2\u00a0to provide assistance, assess the situation, and alleviate impacts. In\u00c2\u00a0particular, scientists are assisting with monitoring the stability of the\u00c2\u00a0landslide area and monitoring debris-dam erosion and river and lake conditions.\n<h2>Monitoring Water Levels and Flood Potential<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_193561\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/03\/Landslide-Map3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-193561\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/03\/Landslide-Map3-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" \/><\/a> USGS preliminary map of the landslide area in northwest Washington that occurred on March 22, 2014.

The river level at the gage dropped\u00c2\u00a0suddenly at about 1:30 pm PDT on Saturday, March 22. The drop in water level\u00c2\u00a0was about 1.2 feet, which is equivalent to a drop in discharge of about 1,200\u00c2\u00a0cubic feet per second.\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/waterdata.usgs.gov\/wa\/nwis\/uv\/?site_no=12167000\">Go online and\u00c2\u00a0see near-real-time data<\/a>.\n\nSince the landslide occurred, the USGS installed three Rapid\u00c2\u00a0Deployment Gages to measure additional water levels and streamflow. These gages\u00c2\u00a0are located downstream from the debris dam, in the lake behind the dam, and\u00c2\u00a0upstream from the lake. In addition, the USGS installed two buoys to measure\u00c2\u00a0lake levels. The newly installed gage downstream from the debris dam also\u00c2\u00a0measures water turbidity, and this information is used to monitor the erosion\u00c2\u00a0rate of the dam.\n\nThe USGS is working with multiple federal, state and local\u00c2\u00a0agencies to monitor the status of the river and debris dam and help assess what\u00c2\u00a0the downstream impact may be on flooding and other variables under different\u00c2\u00a0streamflows and debris-dam erosion rates.\n<h2>No Associated Earthquake<\/h2>\nSeismograph\u00c2\u00a0readings show no indication that an earthquake triggered the landslide near\u00c2\u00a0Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014. Seismographic recordings of the landslide\u00c2\u00a0event show two impulsive wave signals. The first is interpreted to represent\u00c2\u00a0the onset of landslide motion at 17:37 UTC, and a second signal is interpreted\u00c2\u00a0to represent a successive slide that occurred at 17:41 UTC. The seismic signals\u00c2\u00a0are of long period surface waves, with no clear high-frequency P or S phases\u00c2\u00a0that we would expect to see if a local tectonic earthquake occurred at the time\u00c2\u00a0of the event. The landslides generated elevated levels of local ground shaking\u00c2\u00a0for over an hour. Seismic readings are from the University of Washington\u00c2\u00a0Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, operated in cooperation with the USGS.\n<h2>Monitoring Slope Stability<\/h2>\n[caption id=\"attachment_193611\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"199\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/washingtonslidepackage\/Spider2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-193611 \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/03\/Spider-21-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> The photograph shows a spider unit being deployed by helicopter to help study the landslide that occurred in northwest Washington on March 22, 2014.

Credit: Jonathan Godt, USGS[\/caption]\n\nA team of landslide geologists from the county, state, and the\u00c2\u00a0USGS are assessing continuing landslide hazard that may pose a threat to search\u00c2\u00a0operations. One example is the USGS deployment of three \u00e2\u0080\u009cspiders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are portable\u00c2\u00a0instrumentation packages that contain high-precision GPS units for detecting\u00c2\u00a0landslide movement as well as geophones for detecting small vibrations. The\u00c2\u00a0spiders can be emplaced by hovering helicopters. Data from the spider units are\u00c2\u00a0transmitted by radio to USGS computers and made available to the monitoring\u00c2\u00a0team.\n<h2>Coordinated Emergency Response<\/h2>\nSnohomish County is the lead responding agency and is\u00c2\u00a0coordinating closely with local agencies. The Washington State Department of Natural\u00c2\u00a0Resources, Washington State Emergency Management Division, and Washington State\u00c2\u00a0Department of Transportation are the primary state staff at the site to help\u00c2\u00a0assess the flood hazard and evaluate how the river may rework the landslide and\u00c2\u00a0debris dam in the next few weeks. Many other organizations are playing a\u00c2\u00a0supportive role and providing all hands on deck to assist.\n<h2>Prior Landslides in the Area<\/h2>\nOther\u00c2\u00a0large, and perhaps sudden, landslides have occurred in this valley and in the\u00c2\u00a0broader region. Large landslides are the norm in many parts of the western\u00c2\u00a0foothills of the North Cascades. The recent landslide in Washington, however,\u00c2\u00a0exhibited unusual mobility (i.e., runout distance and probable speed) compared\u00c2\u00a0to previously studied events in the area. Examination of high-resolution,\u00c2\u00a0remotely sensed topography indicates the presence of similar landslides that\u00c2\u00a0may have travelled long distances.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_193621\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"432\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/images\/washingtonslidepackage\/LandslidePhoto.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-193621   \" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/03\/Landslide-Photo1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"287\" \/><\/a> Photograph from aerial survey showing the upper parts of the landslide that occurred in northwest Washington on March 22, 2014.

Credit: Jonathan Godt, USGS[\/caption]\n<h2>Type\u00c2\u00a0of Landslide<\/h2>\nThis\u00c2\u00a0landslide appears to have involved a complex sequence of events. USGS landslide\u00c2\u00a0specialists, in collaboration with seismologists and state agencies, are still\u00c2\u00a0working to interpret the event.\n\nMuch\u00c2\u00a0of the landslide deposit has character that resembles that of the great Mount\u00c2\u00a0St. Helens rockslide, which was a debris avalanche on May 18, 1980, and the\u00c2\u00a0largest landslide in recorded history. The distal part of the landslide\u00c2\u00a0deposit, in the region roughly south of the alignment of State Route 530, resembles\u00c2\u00a0that of a debris flow. Debris flows are liquefied slurries of rock, water and\u00c2\u00a0mud that can travel great distances at high speeds, entraining nearly all\u00c2\u00a0objects in their paths. Some of the landslide material remaining north of the\u00c2\u00a0Stillaguamish River, closest to the top of the landslide, has the character of\u00c2\u00a0landslides that scientists classify as rotational slumps.\n<h2>USGS:\u00c2\u00a0Start with Science<\/h2>\nLandslides\u00c2\u00a0occur in all 50 states and U.S. territories, and cause $1-2 billion in damages\u00c2\u00a0and more than 25 fatalities on average each year. Falling rocks, mud, and\u00c2\u00a0debris flows are one of the most common and sometimes deadly hazards, yet there\u00c2\u00a0is still much to learn about how and why they happen.\n\nUSGS science is helping answer questions such as where, when and how often\u00c2\u00a0landslides occur, and how fast and far they might move. USGS scientists produce\u00c2\u00a0maps of areas susceptible to landslides and identify what sort of rainfall\u00c2\u00a0conditions will lead to such events.
