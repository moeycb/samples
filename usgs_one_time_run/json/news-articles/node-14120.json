To help public agencies and resource managers minimize risk and damage to California&rsquo;s infrastructure, the USGS is studying and providing information on groundwater conditions and land subsidence in the San Joaquin Valley.<\/p>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">What:<\/td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Press conference to announce release of scientific report and discuss results of study on subsidence in California&rsquo;s San Joaquin Valley.<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Who:<\/td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Michelle Sneed, USGS Hydrologist and lead report author<br \/>Eric Reichard, USGS California Water Science Center Director<br \/>Richard Woodley, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Assistant Regional Director<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">When:<\/td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Thursday, November 21, 2013<br \/>10:00 a.m., Press conference in Sacramento<br \/>2:00 p.m., Site visit and photo opportunity at Delta-Mendota Canal, south of Los Banos<br \/><br \/><\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">Where:&nbsp;<\/td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Press Conference<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=Modoc+Hall,+CSUS,+Sacramento,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=36.890605,-120.654602&amp;sspn=1.722161,3.147583&amp;hnear=Modoc+Hall,+3020+State+University+Dr+E,+Sacramento,+California+95819&amp;t=m&amp;z=17\">U.S. Geological Survey, Modoc Hall<\/a>, Willow Conference Room 1\r\n<p>3020 State University Drive East, Sacramento, California<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Paid parking permits available from machine in lot adjacent to Modoc Hall.<\/li>\r\n<li>For reporters unable to attend in person, an audio bridge will be available:<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>(703) 648-4848 or toll-free (855) 547-8255, code 77680#<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Photo Op \/ Field Site:<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=N+Russell+Ave+and+W+Althea+Ave,+near+Firebaugh,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=36.890605,-120.654602&amp;spn=1.722161,3.147583&amp;sll=36.898705,-120.663185&amp;sspn=0.120804,0.196724&amp;hnear=N+Russell+Ave+%26+W+Althea+Ave,+Firebaugh,+Fresno+County,+California+93622&amp;t=m&amp;z=9\">Delta-Mendota Canal where it crosses Russell Avenue<\/a>, south of Los Banos, and west of Firebaugh.
