The workshop includes a day of talks and posters and a full-day field trip highlighting fault zones and the Cerros del Rio Volcanic Field. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nGround water in the Espa&ntilde;ola basin is the primary source of drinking water for Santa Fe, Los Alamos, and a number of Indian Pueblo nations. Improving the understanding of the three-dimensional hydrogeologic framework of the basin is necessary for better management of its ground water. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis 6th annual workshop provides a forum for scientists from Federal, State and local government agencies and academia to exchange information, develop goals, report progress to technical communities, and establish a working relationship with decision-makers. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>When:<\/strong> March 6 &amp; 7 \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>Where:<\/strong> Santa Fe Community College, Main Building, Jemez Rooms 1, 2, and 3 (first day) \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a map, go to: <a href=\"http:\/\/esp.cr.usgs.gov\/ebtag\/Espwk6_maps.html\">http:\/\/esp.cr.usgs.gov\/ebtag\/Espwk6_maps.html<\/a> \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe second-day field trip is currently full, but some seats may open at the last minute.
