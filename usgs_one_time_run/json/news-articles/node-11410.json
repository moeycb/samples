Perhaps less understood is that water use can degrade water quality by releasing naturally occurring contaminants, like salts, uranium and radium, into streams and aquifers, thereby constraining water availability. <br \/><br \/>Rep. Grace Napolitano, Chairwoman of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, and the Water Environment Federation invite you to a briefing to examine the factors that limit the water available for critical uses throughout the country. The briefing is held in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. <br \/><br \/>This briefing will explain and provide examples of the connections between water use and water quality and how they can ultimately affect water availability for critical uses. <br \/><br \/><strong>When:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Thursday, March 20<br \/>10:00am - 12:00pm<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Where:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Room HC 5 United States Capitol Building <strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Who:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">David Anning, NAWQA scientist, USGS<br \/>David Kanzer, Colorado River Water Conservation District <br \/>Robert Hirsch, Associate Director for Water, USGS <br \/>Claudia Copeland, Congressional Research Service<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Resources:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/corecast\/podcasts\/audio\/cbs\/salinity_briefing.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Congressional briefing recording<\/a> (111 MB) - Transcript available in 7 - 10 days<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/newsroom\/docs\/toxics_handout.doc\">Briefing paper<\/a> (handout - Word)<\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nawqa\/studies\/mrb\/salinity.html\">Decreases in Salinity Noted in Southwestern Streams<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nawqa\/use_quality.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Water Availability&mdash;The Connection Between Water Use and Quality<\/a> (PDF)<br \/> <\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/toxics.usgs.gov\/pubs\/FS-027-02\/index.html\">Pharmaceuticals, Hormones, and other Organic Wastewater Contaminants in U.S. Streams<\/a><br \/><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"1205812800","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169267"},{"tid":"169606"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
