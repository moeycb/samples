The three largest consuming countries were the United States with 23 tcf, Russia with 17 tcf, and Iran with 4 tcf of natural gas per year in 2008.<\/p>\r\n<p>Russia&rsquo;s West  Siberian Basin is another large natural gas province with an estimated 643 tcf. The Middle East and North Africa region also has several large provinces, which include the Rub Al Khali Basin with 426 tcf, the Greater Ghawar Uplift with 227 tcf, and the Zagros Fold Belt with 212 tcf. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Some natural gas accumulations in the United States include the Southwestern Wyoming Province with an estimated 85 tcf, the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Province with 73 tcf, and the Appalachian Basin Province of the eastern United  States and the Western Gulf Basin Province of Texas and Louisiana, each with 70 tcf.<\/p>\r\n<p>All of these estimates are mean estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas resources.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Nile Delta Basin Province also holds an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and 5.9 billion barrels of natural gas liquids (mean estimates). Worldwide consumption of petroleum was about 31 billion barrels in 2008.<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS conducted this assessment as part of a program to estimate the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of priority petroleum basins around the world.
