The location of the flare and direction of the \r\nCME make it a near certainty that the ejected material will reach the Earth \r\nwithin the next 24 hours. Thus, it should produce geomagnetic activity and a \r\nresulting aurora that may be visible at mid-latitudes, and could continue for \r\nseveral days. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Geomagnetic storms occur when plasma, a hot ionized gas of charged particles \r\nproduced by eruptions on the Sun, impacts the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field causing it \r\nto fluctuate wildly. These fluctuations cause currents to flow in conductors on \r\nthe ground and in space. Solar eruptions can produce billions of tons of plasma \r\ntraveling at speeds in excess of a million miles an hour. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS provides valuable geomagnetic data to a wide variety of users and \r\norganizations that are affected by geomagnetic storms. The agency operates a \r\nnetwork of 14 magnetic observatories that continuously monitor the Earth&rsquo;s \r\nmagnetic field. The data are collected in near-real time via satellite to a \r\ndownlink center located in Golden, Colo., and provided to numerous customers \r\nincluding NOAA&rsquo;s Space Environment Center and the U.S. Air Force Space Command \r\nCenter. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Plots of the data from USGS observatories can be seen on-line at: <a \r\nhref=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\/frames\/plots.htm\">http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\/frames\/plots.htm<\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"960350400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169640"},{"tid":"169167"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
