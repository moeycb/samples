{"title":"state-of-the-Art Tools Used to Identify Water-Bearing Bedrock Aquifers in Rye and Seabrook, NH","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>State-of-the-art tools, such as radar and video cameras and other techniques, were used to describe fractured bedrock aquifers and determine the direction of water flowing in rocks underlying Seabrook and Rye, New Hampshire. The advanced methods and tools that were used are highlighted in recently published reports by the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). \n<p>As bedrock aquifers generally yield small quantities of water to wells compared to sand and gravel aquifers, information on the primary direction water flowing to wells is needed to identify and protect this water resource. Bedrock wells in the towns of Seabrook and Rye were selected for the investigations because of the high yields of water from the wells and the geology of the area. \r\n<p>\"Many towns and communities in New Hampshire have limited amounts or an absence of sand and gravel aquifers, forcing towns to look for additional water resources in bedrock,\" said Carole Johnson and Thomas Mack, hydrologists and author\u00c3\u00ads of the reports.\"Knowing the characteristics of the rock in areas with high-yield wells could be useful to town and state agencies in locating other high-yield wells in areas of similar geology, and identify areas of the aquifer that needs protection,\" says Johnson and Mack. \r\n<p>Copies of the reports Open-File Report 98-558, titled \"Borehole-geophysical characterization of a fractured-bedrock aquifer, Rye, New Hampshire,\" by Carole D.
