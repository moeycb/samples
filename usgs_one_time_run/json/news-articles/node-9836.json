Browsing through the information is dynamic and also allows many levels of focus.\"<\/strong> <\/p>\r\n<p>GeoMediaTM has six modules: Understanding Maps, Time and Change, the Greenhouse Effect, the Carbon Cycle, Earthquakes, and the Water Cycle. Each module consists of four sections: Animation, Elements, Glossary, and Further Reading.<\/FONT> <\/p><\/TD><\/TR><\/TBODY><\/TABLE><br>\r\n<p>Partnership projects such as this CRADA allow the federal government and a non-federal partner to combine resources and provide cost-effective products and perform research by sharing the costs of projects. The collaborating partner agrees to provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources needed to conduct a specific research or development effort while the federal government agrees to provide similar resources but not funds directly to the partner. USGS Director Gordon Eaton said, \"Partnerships such as the one between the USGS and InterNetwork Media offer exciting new possibilities for sharing the technical expertise of the federal research community with the private sector. The end result is a cost effective method for commercializing federally-developed technology.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1994, the USGS and InterNetwork Media, Inc., received the Presidential Design Award for Excellence presented by President Clinton for the prototype CD-ROM science journal entitled \"Arctic Data Interactive.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>The U.S. Geological Survey, part of the Department of the Interior, is the federal government&rsquo;s largest civilian mapping agency, largest water resources science and information agency, and largest earth science agency and has just taken on a new biological science responsibility. It is dedicated to providing the nation with reliable, impartial information to describe and understand the Earth. This information is used by more than 1,000 local, state and federal organizations to minimize the loss of life and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources; enhance and protect the quality of life; and contribute to wise economic and physical development. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"843710400","timezone":"UTC","timezone_db":"UTC","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170071"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}
