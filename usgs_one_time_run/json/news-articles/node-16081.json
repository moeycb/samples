USGS will also conduct aerial surveys along the Gulf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coastline to photograph coastal change from the storm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waves and currents.\n\n<strong>USGS Flood Monitoring Network:<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174964\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/la.water.usgs.gov\/Flood2011Multimedia.html\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174964 \" title=\"boat_truck\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/09\/boat_truck-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"USGS boat launched during 2011 flood waters in Louisiana.\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a> USGS boat launched during 2011 flood waters in Louisiana.[\/caption]\n\nFor more than 125 years, the USGS has monitored flow in selected streams and rivers across the U.S. through an extensive streamgaging network. More than 7500\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/nsip\/\">streamgages<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0throughout the U.S. provide real-time information of river and stream flow which is routinely used for water supply and management, monitoring floods and droughts, bridge and road design, determination of flood risk, and for many recreational activities.\n\n<strong>Rising Floodwaters from Isaac: <\/strong>\n\nSeveral southern states have experienced significant flooding as a result of rains from Hurricane Isaac.\n\nMultiple USGS field crews from several states are recording high-water marks, collecting discharge measurements and obtaining water quality data in coastal and inland <a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/index.php?r=al&amp;m=flood&amp;w=map\">Alabama<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/?m=flood&amp;r=ms&amp;w=map\">Mississippi<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/?m=flood&amp;r=la&amp;w=map\">Louisiana<\/a>. This information is important because it is used by the National Weather Service to issue flood warnings, and the data is also used by emergency responders and planners to mitigate current and future flood hazards. These crews are being augmented by USGS staff from the Georgia Water Science Center. As the storm continues to move, crews from Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and Arkansas remain ready to address flooding along the storm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s track.\n\nUSGS field crews have also begun retrieving the 170 storm surge sensors and 17 temporary real-time gages that were deployed in response to Hurricane Isaac in locations where the storm has passed.\u00c2\u00a0Data from these sensors networks will be uploaded to the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/waterwatch.usgs.gov\/hsss\/index.php?\">USGS Hurricane Storm Tide Sensor Map<\/a>. \u00c2\u00a0The sensors provide\u00c2\u00a0critical data for more accurate modeling and prediction capabilities and allows for improved structure designs and response for public safety.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_174966\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/09\/3d_image_yellowleaf.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174966  \" title=\"3d_image_yellowleaf\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2012\/09\/3d_image_yellowleaf-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"Three dimensional (3D) topographic and bathymetric model of Yellowleaf Creek, AL.\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a> Three dimensional (3D) topographic and bathymetric model of Yellowleaf Creek, AL.[\/caption]\n\n<strong>New 3-D Mapping Technology to Measure Isaac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Flooding<\/strong>\n\nA new technology is being used by the USGS to map flooding in certain urban areas caused by the hurricane.

The USGS has not previously used T-lidar for flood work.\n\n<strong>Drought Persists in other parts of the U.S. <\/strong>\n\nAlthough Isaac has brought significant precipitation in its wake, much of the country continues to be plagued by severe drought conditions.\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/droughtmonitor.unl.edu\/\">The U.S. Drought Monitor<\/a> has provided the latest drought impacts for the states listed below.
