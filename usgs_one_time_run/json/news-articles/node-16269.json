Nadar took photographs of Paris from the gondola of a balloon in 1858 but was better known as a photographer of artists, poets, composers, and other celebrities of the time; among his subjects was Louis Daguerre, inventor of the daguerreotype process of photography[\/caption]\n\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/my.usgs.gov\/confluence\/display\/nationalmapcorps\/Home\">National Map Corps<\/a> (TNMCorps) volunteers continue to make significant additions to the U.S. Geological Survey's ability to provide accurate mapping information and data to the public.\n\nUsing crowd sourcing techniques, volunteers have verified, corrected, or collected more than 62,000 manmade structures providing accurate and authoritative data for the National Geospatial Program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web-based\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/\">The National Map<\/a> (TNM) and ultimately <a href=\"http:\/\/nationalmap.gov\/ustopo\/index.html\">US Topo maps<\/a>\n\nStructures include schools, hospitals, post offices, police stations, and other important public places.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/vgistructures_rewards.html\">original seven<\/a> recognition categories range from 25 to 2000+ points; the images themselves are line drawings from a 1909 Keuffel &amp; Esser catalog of drafting and surveying instruments.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_202991\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/10\/VGI-badge-pigeon.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-202991\" src=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/blogs\/features\/files\/2014\/10\/VGI-badge-pigeon-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" \/><\/a> <br \/>Flock of Winged Witnesses<br \/>4000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 4999 points<br \/>The first pigeon mounted camera was designed by German pharmacist Julius Neubronner in 1903. The innovation was brought about by Neubronner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in photography and his practice of receiving and delivering prescriptions by pigeon.[\/caption]\n\nEach badge comes with a description of the item and encouragement to achieve the next level. As a volunteer attains each level, a congratulatory email is sent, and the\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/Rewards\/Rewards_System\/Catergory_Members\/Category_Members.htm\">accomplishments are recognized<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0via\u00c2\u00a0The National Map\u00c2\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/USGSTNM\">Twitter <\/a>\u00c2\u00a0(#TNMCorps).

The Maul Camera Rocket was one of the first such devices that produced sharp images due to Maul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovation of using gyroscopes to stabilize the rocket and fins to prevent rotation of the rocket. The history of rocket cameras was short due to the development of the airplane.[\/caption]\n\nWith the overwhelming response from dedicated volunteers it soon became apparent that additional categories were necessary.\u00c2\u00a0 The first volunteer to reach the highest recognition level, the <a href=\"http:\/\/navigator.er.usgs.gov\/help\/Rewards\/Rewards_System\/Reward_Categories\/Theodolite_Assemblage.htm\">Theodolite Assemblage<\/a>, did so on July 3, 2013 just two months after the start of the recognition program!

From these activities during war time evolved the science of photogrammetry.[\/caption]\n\nThe first set of recognition badges features antique surveying equipment.\u00c2\u00a0 The new recognition badges take to the air and are based on early aerial observation of the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface.\u00c2\u00a0 Badges include the balloon that took the first aerial image, a pigeon with an attached camera, a rudimentary rocket, and a biplane with a cameraman leaning out the cockpit. Get more information about these icons by visiting the recognition badge pictures featured on this page.\n\nThough there was some interest in using pigeons for reconnaissance purposes during both of the World Wars, the airplane proved to be more reliable. The use of pigeon-based photographs was most popular at fairs and exhibitions where individuals could purchase freshly produced aerial images in the form of postcards, some of which included the pigeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wingtips in the margin of the photograph.\n\nThe Maul Camera Rocket was developed by German engineer Alfred Maul in 1904.
