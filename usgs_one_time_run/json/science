Reframing public conception of seasonal changes already being observed\u2014using the lens of phenology as a science\u2014encourages people to take a closer look at what they see around them day-to-day and year-to-year and better understand how our ecosystems are responding to environmental changes. A variety of educational and communication models can be used to assist in reframing the public conception of seasonal changes and species response. Providing programmatic educational resources, communication tools, and conceptual materials to educators, scientists, resource managers and other key stakeholders assists in improving the public's understanding of the importance of phenological change, increases scientific literacy, and offers a framework for engaging in conversation about climate change and environmental variation.To support research activities related to advancing science and informing decisions, we will use phenology as a construct to improve public understanding of science and environmental change to build public support for science and proactive adaptation to environmental change.

Early tests of various new radar systems show promise, but much more testing and development are needed before major improvements in technology can be realized.<\/span><\/p>","summary":"","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"<p>Although there have been great advances in methods for measuring water levels, computing streamflow, and storing and transmitting data, the methods for measuring flow at most streamgages are almost identical to those of 100 years ago. At a growing number of streamgages, however, the use of acoustic Doppler technology is dramatically changing the way flow is measured. These acoustic methods enhance the range of conditions for which accurate flow measurements are possible, but they do not provide enhanced efficiency or accuracy at most locations.\u00a0No new technology has yet been found to provide accurate data over a wide range of hydrologic conditions more cost-effectively than traditional current-meter methods. Prudent management, however, requires that the USGS continue efforts to explore and test new technologies for streamgaging that have the potential to enhance operational safety, reduce cost, improve accuracy, and (or) increase reliability of flow data. The USGS is collaborating with university and private-sector partners in a search for new approaches to streamgaging.
