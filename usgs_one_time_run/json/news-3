Moncure is about 40 miles southwest of Raleigh. <\/p>\n<p>North Carolina health officials announced the finding on Friday, October 20, 2000. The crow was found September 27, 2000, at Jordan&rsquo;s Lake State Park by a federal employee working in the park. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS scientists predicted in September that the West Nile Virus was on the move and was heading south. The virus, considered a special threat to crows, killed 7 people last year, has sickened 16 people in the Northeast and killed an elderly New Jersey man this year. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Am I surprised to see it spread into North Carolina? No. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see it spread further south,\" said Dr. Robert McLean, chief of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center that did the crow necropsy. \"USGS will continue to test samples and monitor the spread of the virus as migrating birds move south.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Primarily a wild bird disease, the virus has affected a small number of people, and human symptoms generally are mild.

Scientists at the USGS used a variety of supporting information in addition to the satellite data, including topography, census, agricultural statistics, soil characteristics, other land cover maps, and wetlands data to determine and label the land cover type for each 30-meter pixel. This imagery database is also being used by the partner organizations for their own programs. <\/p>\r\n<p>The NLCD was designed to be compatible with the earlier Land Use\/Land Cover data set compiled from 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s aerial photography. The data from these two time periods provide an opportunity to investigate the land cover change in the United States over the last 30 years.

As they migrate, mosquitoes in new areas may become infected and then carry that infection on to humans. So far this year, the virus has caused 16 people to become ill and led to one death. <\/p>\r\n<p>Other mammals also appear at risk: three species of bats, a raccoon, eight horses and an eastern chipmunk have all tested positive for the virus, McLean said.

Mercury is a well-known environmental pollutant that can have serious effects on human health. <\/p>\n<p>\"Liquid elemental mercury, or quicksilver, was used extensively in the Bear and Yuba River watersheds since the early gold mining days,\" said Charlie Alpers, USGS Research Chemist, the study&rsquo;s chief scientist. \"Our fish survey is part of the first comprehensive investigation in the Sierra Nevada region of mercury distribution in water, sediment, and biota, and the potential risks to human health and ecosystems.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS report contains data on 141 samples of fish collected during September and October 1999 from reservoirs and stream environments in Nevada, Placer, and Yuba counties. The five reservoirs sampled were Englebright Lake, Scotts Flat Reservoir, Rollins Lake, Lake Combie, and Camp Far West Reservoir. The main target species in these reservoirs was largemouth bass - other species that were sampled included smallmouth and spotted bass, channel catfish, crappie, green sunfish, and bluegill. Brown trout and rainbow trout were sampled predominantly from 17 stream sites, although a small number of trout were also taken from some of the reservoirs.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mercury concentrations in bass ranged from 0.20 to 1.5 parts per million (ppm), wet basis. Mercury concentrations in sunfish ranged from less than 0.10 to 0.41 ppm. Channel catfish had mercury concentrations from 0.16 to 0.75 ppm. The range of mercury concentrations observed in rainbow trout was from 0.06 to 0.38 ppm, and in brown trout was from 0.02 to 0.43 ppm. For reference, the Food and Drug Administration action level for commercial fish is 1.0 ppm and the State of California considers mercury levels above 0.3 ppm indicative of the need for further study.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Elemental mercury, the kind you can see, is only one part of the problem,\" said Jason May, USGS Biologist. \"It is the presence of methylmercury, the organic form of mercury that accumulates in organisms, that will be of most concern.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin that is known to be especially detrimental to developing fetuses and young children. Methylmercury is known to biomagnify, or increase in concentration, as it moves up the food chain. Concentrations tend to be highest in predatory fish - those that eat other fish. Some examples of predatory fish are bass and brown trout. The predominant form of mercury in edible fish tissue is methylmercury. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS has submitted its data to the California Environmental Protection Agency and their Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). Environmental health officials from Nevada, Placer, and Yuba counties will be working closely with OEHHA toxicologists to determine whether formal notification to the public will be made concerning potential risks from fish consumption in these areas. According to OEHHA, a total of 12 water bodies in California - including San Francisco Bay, Clear Lake, and Lake Berryessa - have fish consumption advisories related to elevated mercury levels. Some of the mercury levels reported by USGS are in a similar range compared with fish from other water bodies in California for which there are consumption advisories. At this time, there are no fish consumption advisories for mercury in California&rsquo;s historic gold mining areas, including the Sierra Nevada and the Trinity-Klamath Mountains.

Steven, a retired research field geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The Dibblee Medal, awarded for excellence in field geology and geologic mapping, is highly coveted by geologists. <\/p>\n<p>The prestigious medal, named for renowned field geologist, Tom Dibblee, is awarded by the Dibblee Geological Foundation (<a href=\"http:\/\/dibblee.geol.ucsb.edu\/\"> http:\/\/dibblee.geol.ucsb.edu<\/a>), a non-profit California educational institution aimed at the timely publication of geological maps. Each medallist has been selected by a committee of peers who recognize the qualities and values of geologic mapping. <\/p>\r\n<p>This year&rsquo;s award was conferred by 88-year old Tom Dibblee at an American Association of Petroleum Geologists meeting in Long Beach, Ca. The citationist was USGS geologist, Peter Rowley, who received the 2nd Dibblee Medal. <\/p>\r\n<p>Steven recently retired from an exemplary 42-year career with the USGS. During this time, he achieved recognition from all quarters of the geologic community as a leading authority on geologic mapping, complex volcanic structures, genesis of ore deposits, and landscape evolution. <\/p>\r\n<p>Tom is a past president of the Colorado Scientific Society and a recipient of the Department of Interior Meritorious Service Award. He has authored over 170 scientific and technical publications, most of which are based on field observations and interpretations. The publications include geologic maps of standard quadrangles and of large regions, reports on mining districts, and syntheses of the genesis and evolutionary trends of magmas and ores in complex volcanic systems. <\/p>\r\n<p>Tom&rsquo;s geologic maps show far more than the distribution of rocks and structures; they are lessons in geologic evolution and processes. For example, through detailed mapping and laboratory investigations, in part with other specialists, he established the first detailed history of the evolution of the rocks of the San Juan, Colorado volcanic field and their role in the formation of associated mineral deposits. His finely crafted reports and maps are models of quality research and presentation. They present complex ideas in comprehensible form and are noted for their complete documentation, imaginative interpretations, and multidisciplinary approach to science, based on \"reading\" the rocks. <\/p>\r\n<p>Steven&rsquo;s experience and expertise in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado subsequently led him to map the Marysvale, Utah volcanic field and contribute to a new understanding of the tectonic and magmatic evolution in that area. Tom was an active partner in the team that developed a modern understanding of calderas, and his contributions were based on careful field observations and interpretation of the rocks. <\/p>\r\n<p>Tom and his wife, Grace, have lived in the Denver area since 1952. After retirement, he continued working on reports at the USGS as a Scientist Emeritus. In addition, he initiated other projects, including an investigation of the geomorphic evolution of the San Juan Mountains. Tom also began writing poetry and has published a 100-page book of poems about growing up in California, the beauty of the scenery he has been privileged to witness as a field geologist, and philosophical meanderings about concepts in geology, science management, and life. <\/p>\r\n<p>In his acceptance speech for the Dibblee Medal, Tom described his life experience in the field as \"...joyous times of solitude when I am alone in the hills trying to read a book that has no title or table of contents, and whose text pages are blank.

The wide geographic distribution of these mortality events and the number of species involved may represent an entirely new phenomenon or may be partly the result of increased surveillance of amphibian populations. Amphibian researchers and land managers worldwide, however, are concerned about the often severe and mostly unexplained declines of amphibian populations on many continents, including in remote and pristine areas. <\/p>\r\n<p>Research by USGS and other scientists has identified many deadly virus infections and chytrid fungus as causes of some recent amphibian die-offs and local population declines. Scientists are actively investigating other hypotheses that could help explain these worldwide declines, including increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation due to ozone thinning, the spread of non-native predators, contamination from pesticides and other chemicals, and rising temperatures.

The 12-foot vertical barrier created by the dam at Little Falls prevents the fish from reaching the 10 miles of historical prime feeding and spawning habitat above the dam. The inability of the fish to traverse the dam may have contributed to the continued decline of the American shad in the Potomac River during the last several decades. Efforts are already under way to monitor the performance of the passage structure by finding adults upstream of the dam. This is a long-term effort because it will take several years for the shad to get reestablished in the new available spawning and feeding areas. <\/p>\r\n<p>The Coastal America Partnership is a multi-agency partnership organization, established in 1992 to restore and protect the coastal environment.

Previous eruptions over a half-million-year period had built the mountain to a height of nearly 12,000 feet. The collapse of Mount Mazama to form the caldera during a catastrophic eruption 7,700 years ago marked the beginning of the formation of the azure blue lake. Snow and rain fell into the 4,000-deep hole, partially filling the caldera to present lake level over a period of about 250 years. Since that time, precipitation entering the lake is offset by evaporation and seepage, so the lake level varies only a few feet each year. At its current measurement, Crater Lake is the seventh deepest lake in the world. <\/p>\r\n<p>Wizard Island, a cinder cone island near the western shore of the steep-sided lake, was formed during an eruption about 7,500 years ago, and is only the tip of a submerged pile of lava. Several other volcanoes, now obscured by the lake, also formed on the floor of the caldera, shortly after the great eruption of Mount Mazama. The present elevation of the highest part of the mountain is about 9,000 feet, with the level of the lake being a little more than 6,000 feet above sea level. <\/p>\r\n<p>The lake and surrounding area became a national park in 1902, and prior to and since that time have been the subject of numerous scientific investigations. Clarence Dutton headed an 1886 USGS survey of the area that measured the depth of the lake in several spots, using lead-weight sounding methods. The most recent USGS survey, published in 1959, was based on about 4,000 echo soundings. In 1988 and 1989, scientists from the USGS, the NPS and Oregon State University made nine dives in &quot;Deep Rover,&quot; a one-person mini-submarine, looking for and filming active volcanic vents on the lake&rsquo;s floor, and the submerged caldera walls. <\/p>\r\n<p>The multibeam sidescan sonar mapping that is scheduled to begin July 24, will collect data from more than 50 million soundings and will mark the first time that the entire bottom of the lake has been mapped using modern technology. The project is similar to the mapping of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, which the USGS conducted in August 1998. The digital maps of Lake Tahoe revealed a lake floor littered with the debris of ancient landslides and confirmed the presence of an active earthquake fault. Other underwater multibeam mapping projects have given scientists dramatic views of the floor of San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay the Pacific Continental Shelf, and parts of the U.S. Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. (See <a href=\"http:\/\/walrus.wr.usgs.gov\/pacmaps\/\">http:\/\/walrus.wr.usgs.gov\/pacmaps\/<\/a>). <\/p>\r\n<p>By mapping the floor of Carter Lake, USGS and other scientists hope the new, detailed, bathymetry study will shed light on certain submerged volcanic landforms and may even lead to the discovery of new vents.

The plan provides the infrastructure and process for forming unique USGS storm-response teams each time a severe coastal storm threatens the lives and property of U.S. citizens in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. <\/p>\r\n<p>The storm-response team is comprised of USGS managers and specialists in the fields of hydrology, biology, mapping, geology, and communications. This team of experts coordinates operations and logistics with the USGS Center for Integration of Natural Disaster Information <a href=\"http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/cindi.usgs.gov<\/a> to ensure the timely and efficient collection and distribution of USGS data that is critical for use by emergency management officials at the local, state, and federal level. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Here at USGS, our goal is to make certain that emergency managers have the critical scientific data they need to make informed decisions on the safety issues that surround hurricanes and other natural hazards, decisions that must be made quickly and can have a significant impact on lives and property,\" said Charles G. Groat, Director of the USGS. \"Communities can also use USGS information when they make decisions on how to ensure a safer tomorrow.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>When a hurricane or severe storm threatens the lives and property of U.S. citizens, USGS geographers respond to requests from local, state, and other federal agencies (Federal Emergency Management Agency, American Red Cross, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency) for maps of areas possibly affected by the potential hazard. Emergency relief workers use these maps to plot the boundaries of a potential disaster area to determine the number of households involved. This vital information is needed to estimate the amount of food, clothing, and shelter that might be needed by people in areas affected by a severe storm. <\/p>\r\n<p>During the storm itself, near \"real-time\" stream data (stage and volume of water) are automatically relayed by satellite telemetry from many locations around the country as part of a nationwide network of USGS streamgaging stations. These crucial data are received by the National Weather Service and other government agencies responsible for issuing flood warnings to safeguard the lives and property of people during a severe storm. Near real-time stream data for stations all over the country are provided at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/realtime.html\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/realtime.html<\/a> on the Internet. <\/p>\r\n<p>In addition, USGS field scientists in coastal states are looking at what natural resources, from beaches and wetlands to endangered species, might be adversely affected by the fury of a hurricane or severe tropical storm. Routine monitoring and data collection of these natural resources before a storm provide USGS scientists with baseline information for comparison of resources after a storm. For instance, habitat mapping of wetlands by aerial photography before and after a storm allows biologists to better understand the possible effects of a hurricane (due to sedimentation and erosion) on a species&rsquo; food supply and living conditions. <\/p>\r\n<p>One possible long-term effect of repeated hurricane activity is greatly accelerated erosion along a coast.

This is the first overall increase observed since spring 1995, when the threatened population reached its highest number of 2,377 individuals. The breakdown of the 2000 survey shows a 13.8 percent increase in pups since spring 1999, and a 10.5 percent increase in adults and subadults, or independents. <\/p>\n<p>The survey, conducted cooperatively by scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey, California Department of Fish and Game, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and with the help of experienced volunteers, covered about 375 miles of California coast, from Half Moon Bay south to Santa Barbara.

Estes in Santa Cruz, Calif. \"Wildlife surveys are inherently imprecise and this is not the first time we have obtained counts that departed substantially from existing trends. Therefore, a sustained trend over the next several years will be required before we can say with any confidence that the period of decline is over.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Low population growth rate has long been a factor in the lagging recovery of the California sea otter, says Estes. The population of sea otters in central California increased this century at an average annual rate of about 5 percent until the mid-1970&rsquo;s, when growth ceased and the population began to decline. Following the state of California&rsquo;s emergency restrictions on set-net fishing, the population increased again until 1995, but has since declined. In 1977 the California sea otter was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. <\/p>\r\n<p>Disease, contaminants, starvation, and entanglement or entrapment in coastal fishing gear may have contributed to the recent sea otter decline, Estes says. The USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., California Department of Fish and Game, and University of California, Davis, have been examining fresh sea otter carcasses to investigate causes of death. As yet, however, there is no evidence that the rate of deaths from disease has increased during the recent declines. <\/p>\r\n<p>Sea otters historically ranged across the North Pacific Ocean from about the mid-section of the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico, to northern Japan. By the end of the 19th century maritime fur traders hunted sea otters to the brink of extinction.

DOQs, or digital orthophotoquads, supplied by the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., were used to help control several wildfires northeast of Santa Fe, according to Gary Kress, the New Mexico State Liaison for the USGS. The maps, produced as the result of an ongoing agreement between the USGS and the U.S. Forest Service, were in the final stage of production when the emergency call came in. <\/p>\n<p>Not only were the New Mexico forestry officials able to get accurate, updated maps of the area, but they were able to get them into the hands of the firefighters in less than 24 hours from the initial request. Charlie Butler of the Las Vegas district office of the New Mexico State Forestry Division expressed his appreciation for the rapid response by the USGS and how invaluable DOQs are for managing forest lands and responding to emergency situations. DOQs were also used to fight the larger fire near Los Alamos. <\/p>\r\n<p>The technical name for the maps may be a mouthful, but DOQs are proving to be the working maps of the 21st century, because they can be produced \"on demand,\" duplicated quickly, delivered electronically and downloaded and printed by the recipient. This is in sharp contrast to a time when topographical maps had to be updated by hand scribers and printed on special presses. This process, from data checking to final print and distribution often took several months, or even years. In addition to being transmitted electronically, DOQs are also available on CD ROMs. <\/p>\r\n<p>By using DOQs rather than traditional topographical maps, firefighters can obtain a more accurate picture of the terrain where a fire is burning and where it might spread. On DOQs, for instance, trees look like trees, rather than just being part of an area of green on a topographic map, which may represent trees, brush or low vegetation. Structures too can be seen for what they are in size, shape and possible use, rather than being depicted as a small box on the map. <\/p>\r\n<p>DOQ images are derived from the archives of the National Aerial Photography Program, housed at the Earth Research Observation Satellite (EROS) Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D. These images, which cover every square foot of the United States, are high-resolution photographs taken from an altitude of 20,000 feet, at a scale of 1:40,000. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS began producing DOQs at its Menlo Park, Calif., mapping center in 1991, in response to a request from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for more efficient method of mapping the nation&rsquo;s soils. Their value in fighting forest fires was soon recognized, and they have been used to plan strategies for fighting several large forest fires throughout the West. <\/p>\r\n<p>Today, nearly 165,000 DOQs of the United States are available, with complete coverage of the conterminous U.S. expected by 2004. Thereafter, most DOQs will be updated every 10 years, with a shorter cycle for those areas where land-use change is more rapid. <\/p>\r\n<p>Because the DOQs can serve as a layer in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), they are especially useful for community and special events planners and for hazard-response personnel. Prior to the 1998 summer Olympics in Atlanta, for example, DOQs were used to produce the maps that were needed by the event planners. They are being used in a similar manner by planners of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics to lay out the event sites and plan transportation corridors. <\/p>\r\n<p>DOQs do not serve the same purpose as the USGS topographic maps that are used by outdoor recreation enthusiasts, and are not meant to replace those popular maps. <\/p>\r\n<p>For years, DOQs were available in digital tape form, by writing or calling the USGS in Menlo Park.

Kendall&rsquo;s study site encompassed 2 million acres - the northern third of the NCDE, an area that stretches from the southern Canadian border to just north of Missoula, Montana (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mesc.usgs.gov\/glacier\/beardna.htm\">http:\/\/www.mesc.usgs.gov\/glacier\/beardna.htm<\/a> for study site boundaries). <\/p>\r\n<p>Although bear numbers for the park are higher than the previous 1970&rsquo;s estimate of 200 grizzly bears in the park, Kendall cautions that because the 1970s estimate was based on bear sightings only, its numbers would not stand up under today&rsquo;s scientific standards for reliability. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Because of this,\" said Kendall, \"we can&rsquo;t use these new, more reliable numbers to say anything about trends, except that in relation to other grizzly populations in the United States, this population appears fairly healthy, with a high density of bears.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Glacier National Park Superintendent Suzanne Lewis said that the park was \"very pleased\" with the preliminary reports generated by Kendall&rsquo;s work. \"It gives the National Park Service insight into the grizzly bear population in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwestern Montana that we&rsquo;ve never had.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Grizzly bears once roamed most of the North American continent, but habitat destruction and direct conflicts with humans have reduced their range by 99 percent in the lower 48 states (see historical and current range maps at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mesc.usgs.gov\/glacier\/dna_detail.htm#Background\">http:\/\/www.mesc.usgs.gov\/glacier\/dna_detail.htm#Background<\/a>).

The USGS has measured floods and supplied streamflow data to the nation for more than 110 years and now has released a new fact sheet listing the most significant floods of the 20th century. <\/p>\n<p>During the 20th century, floods were the number-one disaster in the United States in terms of lives lost and property damage, according to the new fact sheet by the USGS. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States. The fact sheet discusses 32 significant floods that occurred during the 20th century. The floods were determined to be significant based on a combination of factors including lives lost, and total damage and are broken down into six types of floods: large regional flooding, flash floods, storm surge floods, ice-jam floods, dam and levee failure and mudflow floods.<\/p>\r\n<p>&quot;The USGS routinely makes many direct measurements during floods and after floods subside,&quot; said USGS research hydrologist and fact sheet author Charles Perry. &quot;We based this new fact sheet on more than 110 years of data that the USGS has collected.&quot; <\/p>\r\n<p>The century&rsquo;s deadliest flood occurred in Galveston, Texas, during a September 1900 Hurricane. As the superstorm rolled ashore along the Gulf Coast, more than 6,000 persons lost their lives in the monster hurricane&rsquo;s storm surge and wind. Ninety percent of the people killed in hurricanes drown as flood waters rise quickly from the storm surge and heavy rains. <\/p>\r\n<p>Flash floods from intense thunderstorms are also deadly. In June 1972, 237 persons lost their lives along Rapid Creek during the Rapid City S.D. flood. Four years later in July 1976, 144 persons were killed by flash floods on the Big Thompson and Cache la Poudre Rivers in Colorado. <\/p>\r\n<p>Nationwide, half of all flash flood deaths are related to automobiles. The fact sheet diagrams the usually fatal consequence of driving through floodwaters. &quot;Water only one foot deep flowing over a road can exert more than 500 pounds of lateral force, which sweeps an automobile into the much deeper water along the roadside,&quot; Perry said. <\/p>\r\n<p>Floods are also the most costly of all natural disasters in the United States. In the spring and summer of 1993, long periods of excessive rainfall in the upper Mississippi River Basin flooded nine states, killed 48 people and resulted in record losses of more than $20 billion -- about half of these damages were to residences, businesses, public facilities, and transportation facilities. More than 55,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 532 counties received federal disaster aid. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS maintains more than 7,000 gaging stations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to monitor streamflow. Real-time streamflow information for most of these stations can be accessed through the World Wide Web, providing flood warning for those in harm&rsquo;s way. These gages can also be connected directly to warning devices in flash-flood prone areas.

At each site, Robowell provided valuable information about the movement of monitored elements in ground water. <\/p>\r\n<p>At the experimental contaminant cleanup site, the robot used a computer voice modem to inform a project chief that an expected plume of contaminated water had arrived so that she could begin sampling the water manually.

Approximately 10 percent of the samples in the USGS study exceed the WHO guideline. <\/p>\r\n<p>Based on ground water samples collected from wells used for irrigation, industrial purposes and research, and public and private water supply, the new map shows in which counties wells might exceed 10 micrograms per liter and several lower concentrations. The countywide findings portrayed on the map were calculated from about 18,850 samples of potable ground water (which are not necessarily current sources of drinking water), and do not represent testing of every well or drinking water supply system in a given county. The map is available at: <a href=\"http:\/\/co.water.usgs.gov\/trace\/arsenic\">http:\/\/co.water.usgs.gov\/trace\/arsenic<\/a>. <\/p>\r\n<p>Arsenic is a naturally occurring element in the environment. Its presence in ground water is largely the result of minerals dissolving naturally over time as rocks and soils weather. <\/p>\r\n<p>Several types of cancer have been linked to arsenic present in drinking water concentrations higher than observed in U.S. drinking water supplies. In addition, high levels of arsenic have been reported to affect the vascular system in people and have been associated with the development of diabetes. <\/p>\r\n<p>Public supply systems exceeding the existing USEPA standard are required to either treat the water or find alternative sources of supply. People served by public water supplies can obtain information on the quality of their drinking water, including arsenic concentrations, directly from their water supplier.

This union of topographic texture with the patterns defined by units of geologic time creates a visual synthesis that has escaped most prior attempts to combine shaded relief with a second characteristic shown by color. <\/p>\r\n<p>By mutually enhancing the landscape and its underlying structure, the map outlines the geologic story of continental collision and break-up, mountain-building, river erosion and deposition, glaciation, volcanism and other events and processes that have shaped the region over the last 2.6 billion years. <\/p>\r\n<p>The new shaded-relief image is made up of 12,000,000 tiny squares, each about one-hundredth of an inch, or a fourth of a millimeter, on each side. The gray tone of each square is a brightness value computed from a mathematical relation that includes the steepness of the ground, the direction that a slope faces, and the positions of an the observer and a simulated sun. <\/p>\r\n<p>The second component of the map, color, represents geologic time, with 52 colors used to depict rocks that range in age from the Precambrian, 2.6 billion years ago, through the Holocene, which includes time from about 10,000 years ago to the present. The orderly sequence of Earth materials, from oldest to youngest, is represented by an equally well-ordered sequence of prismatic colors, based on the rainbow. Under this scheme, the oldest rocks in the nation, those of the Superior Uplands of Wisconsin and Minnesota, and the Appalachian Mountains, are depicted in reds, purples and blues. The youngest parts of the nation, such as coastal areas and the great valleys of the West, are depicted by gray and beige, while greens, yellows and oranges depict the middle-aged areas that were formed in the Cretaceous and Tertiary ages, between 144 and 2 million years ago. <\/p>\r\n<p>The winding course of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon is marked on the map by a vivid contrast in pattern and color. A narrow ribbon of red cuts through a field of blue as it differentiates the ancient granites and tilted metamorphic rocks (2.6 billion years ago) along the river&rsquo;s banks, from the younger, overlying horizontal Paleozoic (560-245 million years ago) sedimentary rocks in the canyon walls and at the rim. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rising from the Great Plains in eastern Wyoming and western South Dakota, the Black Hills are conspicuous on the map by the red outcrop of Precambrian granite.

Property losses from the earthquake are estimated at $3 to 6.5 billion, which is equivalent to as much as three percent of the gross national product of Turkey. By comparison, according to Dr. Thomas L. Holzer, lead author of the &quot;Implications&quot; publication, earthquake-loss models predict large earthquakes on either the San Andreas or Hayward faults in the San Francisco Bay area would displace more than 100,000 people and cause tens of billions of dollars in damage to public and private property. &quot;While fatalities would probably be significantly less than in Turkey,&quot; Holzer said, &quot;tens of thousands of injuries are to be expected.&quot; <\/p>\r\n<p>The new USGS circular points out that the North Anatolian fault system in Turkey is very similar to the San Andreas fault system in California. Some of the same USGS scientists who estimated a 62 percent probability for more large earthquakes that would damage Istanbul, Turkey during the next 30 years, have assigned a probability figure of 70 percent for one or more large earthquakes to occur in the San Francisco Bay area during the next 30 years. <\/p>\r\n<p>The 20,000 buildings that collapsed in Turkey was the principal cause of deaths and injuries. Nearly all those buildings, in addition to those that were damaged beyond repair, were made of reinforced concrete, a common construction style in the U.S. &quot;Some buildings and bridges in the Bay Area are vulnerable to catastrophic collapse when they are shaken by the oscillatory motion of large earthquakes,&quot; said Holzer. &quot;The collapse of the Cypress Street viaduct in Oakland, which killed 42 people during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, is an example of the seismic failure of a concrete structure that was extremely vulnerable to such oscillations.&quot; <\/p>\r\n<p>Although shaking of structures is responsible for more than 90 percent of the damage resulting from earthquakes, shifting and sinking of the ground surface can be even more destructive than shaking. Liquifaction, which transforms seemingly solid ground into a liquid-like material, caused many of the buildings in Turkey to sink into the ground and sometimes topple over. Liquifaction was also responsible for the collapse of the ground-floor stories of many buildings in the Marina District of San Francisco during the Loma Prieta earthquake. &quot;The sinking of buildings suggests a failure mechanism that may be very important to the levee systems in the Sacramento Delta and other vulnerable parts of the U.S.,&quot; Holzer said. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS Circular 1193 contains 54 pages of narrative, dramatic color photographs, maps and graphic that describe the Turkish earthquake.

In this and many other bird species, chicks that are exposed to human beings may become \"imprinted\" on them, and grow up preferring the company of people to that of their own kind. Thus, to acquire a crane identity, chicks must be fed and cared for by cranes &ndash; or as close as possible as the crane recovery team can get! So nobody is allowed near the chicks unless they are in a crane costume, with a hand puppet shaped like a crane head for feeding the young birds.<\/p>\r\n<p>*A few days before they are hatched, eggs about to hatch are played tapes of the brood calls parent cranes give to their hatching young. <\/p>\r\n<p>*After one day, chicks are placed in small pens next to adult whooping cranes, which will serve as role models for proper imprinting of the chicks.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>DETAILS:<\/b> The USGS whooping crane breeding and rearing facility in Maryland is essential to the species recovery effort. Whooping crane numbers reached an all-time low in 1941, when only 21 birds remained in the wild. With only one small flock of whooping cranes left in the United States, researchers realized that the species was living on borrowed time. Disease could easily sweep through the wild flock, or a natural event such as a severe storm could reduce crane numbers to a point from which recovery would be impossible. A small flock also meant that closely related birds were breeding with each other, causing low fertility rates and developmental problems in chicks. <\/p>\r\n<p>About 10 breeding pairs of cranes are kept at the USGS research center at any one time.

Every day, Landsat 7 collects and downlinks 250 scenes of data \r\nto be archived at the EROS Data Center, and an additional 200 unique scenes are \r\ndownlinked to nearly a dozen international ground-receiving stations located \r\naround the world. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Spacecraft operations are being performed daily at a Goddard mission \r\noperations center. NASA controllers will continue to operate the spacecraft \r\nuntil Oct. 1, 2000, when this function will be turned over to the U.S. \r\nGeological Survey. The Landsat Project Office, located at Goddard, managed the \r\ndevelopment, testing and launch of Landsat 7. Goddard also was responsible for \r\ndeveloping the ground operations system, as well as the ground data handling and \r\nprocessing systems. Landsat 7 is part of a global research program known as \r\nNASA&rsquo;s Earth Science Enterprise, a long-term program that is focused on studying \r\nchanges in the Earth&rsquo;s global environment. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>For more information on Landsat 7 visit:<br><a \r\nhref=\"http:\/\/landsat7.usgs.gov\/\">h","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"956203200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169811"},{"tid":"169992"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Obituary &mdash; Harold L.

This trend is \r\natypical because the value of domestic minerals production has increased in 31 \r\nof the past 39 years. The top three states for production were California ($3.2 \r\nbillion), Nevada ($2.8 billion), and Arizona ($2.5 billion). Consumption of many \r\nindustrial minerals, especially crushed stone (1.6 billion metric tons) and \r\ncement (111 million metric tons), remained firm in 1999, even though the pace of \r\nnew construction slowed during the latter half of the year. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Imports of processed mineral material were valued at an estimated $62 \r\nbillion, and exports were valued at an estimated $33 billion.

It was, however, the perfect earthquake at \r\nthe perfect time for scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the \r\nSouthern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), who were gearing up for \"LARSE \r\nII,\" the Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment II, which got underway on October \r\n20. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Gary Fuis, one of the lead scientists on that project will describe the \r\ncomponents of that experiment and its importance to the Los Angeles community, \r\nin a poster session at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of \r\nAmerica, at the Hanalei Hotel, in San Diego, April 9-12. Fuis&rsquo;s poster \r\npresentation will be from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday, April 10. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>After each large earthquake, many residents of southern California ask \r\nwhether a strong earthquake could occur near their home and how much the ground \r\nwill shake due to any large earthquake in the region. \"We can&rsquo;t answer either of \r\nthose questions until we have an accurate picture of the network of active \r\nfaults and other structures that underlie the Los Angeles region,\" Fuis said, \r\n\"and the best way to can get that picture is to obtain seismic images of the \r\nearth&rsquo;s crust, similar to &rsquo;ultrasound&rsquo; and &rsquo;CAT-scan&rsquo; images that are made as \r\npart of medical tests. To obtain these types of seismic images we need to create \r\nsmall sources of underground sound-wave energy. In LARSE II we used underground \r\nexplosions.\" \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>LARSE II is the second phase of a project that began in 1994, following the \r\nNorthridge earthquake of January 17, that year. During the experiment, sound \r\nwaves were generated by 93 explosive charges, detonated over 60 feet beneath the \r\nsurface in specially-drilled boreholes, located approximately 1 kilometer (0.6 \r\nmiles) apart. The sound waves produced by the detonations were received by over \r\n1400 portable seismographs spaced every 100 meters (approximately 100 yards) \r\nalong a line from Pacific Palisades to the San Fernando Valley, then northward \r\nacross the Mojave Desert to the Tehachapi Mountains. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The line was chosen in the hopes that the resulting data would yield \r\ninformation about many underground structures, including \"blind\" thrust faults-- \r\nburied ramp-like faults that do not extend to the surface, such as the fault on \r\nwhich the Northridge earthquake occurred. Knowing the configuration of buried \r\nfaults is crucial to understanding how the entire earthquake-producing mechanism \r\nworks in the Los Angeles region.

The medal will be presented to Brabb at the opening ceremony of the 25th General Assembly of the EGS, on April 24. <\/p>\n<p>The Soloviev Medal was established by the EGS&rsquo;s working group on natural hazards, and is reserved for scientists who have made \"exceptional contributions to natural hazards, in particular, for their research aiming at an improvement of our knowledge of basic principles, as well as for the assessment and proper mitigation of hazards, in view of environmental protection and the integrity of human life and socio-economic systems.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Brabb, who is only the second American among 122 recipients of a medal from the EGS, was selected for the honor, based on his more than 30 years of mapping landslide-prone areas, especially those in San Mateo County, California. Brabb was the founder and first coordinator of the USGS Regional Landslide Research Group. Under his leadership, in the 1980s, the group published several San Mateo County landslide maps, showing areas where landslides and debris flows have occurred in the past and where they are likely to occur in the future. These maps were used by the county to greatly reduce the number of houses permitted in landslide-prone areas, and to require geologic reports to make certain any houses could be built safely. <\/p>\r\n<p>In 1980 Brabb helped the Italian Research Institute for Hydrogeological Protection of Central Italy establish a summer school for young Italian scientists, to teach them about the landslide techniques developed in San Mateo County and elsewhere. He is also the founder of the International Landslide Research Group (ILRG), and co-founder of the International Conference and Field Workshop on Landslides (ICFL), which provides communication with landslide researchers throughout the world, and co-founder of the International Conference and Field Workshop on Landslides (ICFL), which provides field trips and education about landslides in many countries. <\/p>\r\n<p>Brabb retired from the USGS in 1994, but has remained an active USGS volunteer, preparing more geologic and landslide-hazard maps. A map that he co-authored with Joe Clogan, showing areas susceptible to debris flows in the United States has just been published and will be part of the Survey&rsquo;s new National Atlas. He has also been instrumental in establishing a website where property owners in southern San Mateo County can go to learn whether their property is vulnerable to landslides, and if so, how much money may be required for investigation and mitigation costs. <\/p>\r\n<p>During his 35-year career with the USGS, Brabb has received numerous honors, including the \"Superior,\" \"Meritorious\" and \"Distinguished Service\" awards of the U.S. Department of the Interior; Federal Scientist of the Year (1985); and the \"Distinguished Practice\" award from the Engineering Geology Section of the Geological Society of America (1988). <\/p>\r\n<p>Brabb, a native of Detroit, Mich., received his bachelor of arts degree &quot;With Distinction&quot; in geology from Dartmouth College (1951); a master of science degree from the University of Michigan (1952); and a Ph.D. in geology from Stanford University (1960). He has been a Fellow of the Geological Society of America, and a member of: the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the International Association of Engineering Geologists, the American Geophysical Union, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Association des Geologues de Bassin de Paris, and founder and member of the International Landslide Research Group and the International Conferences and Field Workshops on Landslides. <\/p>\r\n<p>Brabb lives in Palo Alto with his wife, Gisela.

One bush soon became several, and by the 1970s, Dr. Oliver was donating rare rhododendron and azaleas to the USGS gardens. Through the years, other USGS employees followed Oliver&rsquo;s example by donating specimen plants from their own gardens. Oliver retired from the USGS in 1997 , but he continues to supervise the care and feeding of these special plants. Mainly through the efforts of Oliver, the USGS center in Menlo Park has the second-largest collection, variety-wise, of rhododendrons in California. The largest collection is at Strybling Arboretum in Golden Gate Park. <\/p>\r\n<p>One of the USGS rare plants is an azalea native to the mountains of North Carolina, and is the only known specimen of its kind in California.

Dr. Melinda Knutson, a conservation scientist with \r\nthe U.S. Geological Survey, said the research on frog and toad populations in \r\ntwo Midwestern states shows that frog and toad abundance and species richness \r\nwere low in urban areas but near normal in agricultural areas. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Despite some risks, Midwestern frog populations seem to coexist with \r\nagriculture, the dominant land use in the region,\" Knutson explained. \"Amphibian \r\npopulations in intensive row-crop agriculture are dependent upon adjacent, less \r\ndisturbed environments, such as forests, grasslands, emergent wetlands, lakes, \r\nand streams. Even small areas of these other cover types may be important in \r\nmaintaining amphibian populations on the landscape.\" \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Stopping declines in amphibian populations has become a national priority. \r\nBefore critical habitat can be retained or restored, quality amphibian habitat \r\nmust be defined. Scientists with the USGS are examining how various landscapes \r\nsuch as wetlands and agricultural areas relate to frog and toad populations. \r\nTheir research may benefit natural resource managers who have been given the \r\ntask of promoting healthy and diverse amphibian populations. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>The new research also confirmed the role of forests as important amphibian \r\nhabitat. While wetlands are their primary breeding habitats, many frog and toad \r\nspecies spend part or all of their nonbreeding season in trees, shrubs, or heavy \r\nlitter, not wetlands, Knutson said. The habitat quality of forests may be just \r\nas important as wetlands for these species. The structure of trees, shrubs, and \r\nunderbrush in a forest creates diverse habitats with many niches. Forests also \r\nmoderate the temperature and evaporation rate of aquatic habitats adjacent to \r\nthem, contribute organic matter, and add diversity to the plant and animal \r\ncommunity in the area. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>In a related study, Knutson and other biologists are investigating the value \r\nof constructed farm ponds for native amphibians. Thousands of farm ponds have \r\nbeen constructed in the Midwest through cost-share programs with the U.S. \r\nDepartment of Agriculture. The purpose of these farm ponds is to prevent soil \r\nerosion and create wildlife habitat, yet few studies have been conducted to \r\ndetermine how the ponds benefit wildlife such as frogs. One product of Knutson&rsquo;s \r\nresearch will be a guide covering the design, construction, and management of \r\nfarm ponds for use by contractors, private landowners, and state or federal \r\nagencies. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>Biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey are helping determine why \r\namphibians are disappearing in the U.S. and across the globe. Research by these \r\nscientists and others has identified many deadly virus infections as well as the \r\nchytrid fungus as factors in some amphibian die-offs and population declines. \r\nScientists are actively investigating other hypotheses that could help explain \r\nthese worldwide declines, including global change, contamination from pesticides \r\nand other chemicals, increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation due to ozone \r\nthinning, and the spread of non-native predators.

One of these two park populations of toads declined precipitously in 1996, and the second showed dramatic declines this past summer. These two park populations were among the largest boreal toad populations in the state. Dr. Erin Muths, a zoologist with the USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Fort Collins, Co., and her colleagues submitted dead toads collected from the park to Dr. D. Earl Green, a wildlife pathologist at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for testing. Samples were also submitted to Dr. Allan Pessier, a veterinarian with the San Diego Zoo. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Fewer than ten toads were caught at one of the park sites where we had previously caught closer to 200,\" said Muths. \"These populations are clearly stressed, but whether this is due entirely to the chytrid fungus or is a combination of stressors acting in concert, we don&rsquo;t know.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Pessier examined dead toads collected in 1998 and found that characteristics of the fungal bodies present on two of the toads were \"consistent with chytrid fungal infections.\" Green examined other toads collected in 1999 and found skin abnormalities that he considered \"suspect\" but inconclusive. Muths and her colleagues will return to the park this spring to continue monitoring the populations. <\/p>\r\n<p>Diagnosis of the chytrid fungus in boreal toads in Rocky Mountain National Park is the second such diagnosis in Colorado. Sick and dying toads were found in a population located on private lands west of Denver in May of 1999 by Colorado Division of Wildlife researchers. USGS pathologists identified chytrid fungus in many of the dead and living toads they examined from that site. Live toads show few clinical signs of the disease, but some may appear weak or lethargic, exhibit excessive shedding of skin and may be reluctant to flee at the approach of humans. These die-offs of amphibians in Rocky Mountain National Park and around the globe are of great concern because amphibians are good barometers of significant environmental changes that may go initially undetected by humans. <\/p>\r\n<p>Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) in amphibians was first identified in 1998 by an international team of scientists from Australia, the United States and Great Britain. This team, which included Dr. Green, discovered that the fungus had most likely been responsible for large - and previously unexplained - amphibian die-offs in pristine areas of Panama and Australia. The disease is now being studied in detail, in order to understand its origin, incidence, distribution and methods of control. In work funded by the National Science Foundation, Muths and Green are collaborating with world-renowned chytrid experts Drs. Joyce Longcore and Seanna Annis, from the University of Maine, on the development of a DNA-based assay to identify the chytrid fungus using molecular techniques. <\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists don&rsquo;t know how this fungus is transmitted from one area to another, let alone why the fungus is affecting amphibian populations around the world.

These die-offs of amphibians in the Southwest and around the globe are of great concern because amphibians are good barometers of significant environmental changes that may go initially undetected by humans. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Childhood memories of the frogs we put in our pockets and carried around are linked to our early awareness of the natural world. Will this generation of schoolchildren be the last to have such associations?\" asked Cecil Schwalbe, a research scientist of the USGS Western Ecological Research Center in Tucson, Ariz. <\/p>\r\n<p>Since the 1970&rsquo;s all seven native true frog species in Arizona have declined to some degree - and some precipitously. Introduction of non-native predators or competitors -fishes, bullfrogs and crayfishes - has been the single most important factor in recent declines of native frog populations in the Southwest, said Schwalbe. Previous loss and degradation of wetland habitat have also affected many populations, but recent studies implicate chytrid fungus as a player in the declines as well. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"We have learned to exclude bullfrogs from ponds used by the native leopard frogs, but we are still trying to understand all of the factors that are causing leopard frog declines,\" Schwalbe said. Researchers are examining the roles of chytrid fungus disease and air quality, but note that at the same time, viable populations of leopard frogs will need to be maintained through conservation efforts until the causes of decline are understood and can be fully addressed. <\/p>\r\n<p>Mike Sredl, a herpetologist with the Arizona Game and Fish Department, noted that the Chiricahua leopard frog is gone from 80 percent of its historical localities in southeastern and central Arizona and southwestern and west-central New Mexico. According to Jim Rorabaugh, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, the frog is found now at only about 79 wetland sites. <\/p>\r\n<p>From 1993 to 1996, researchers from the USGS, the USFWS, AGFD, and the University of Arizona conducted intense conservation efforts in extreme southeastern Arizona on San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, at Douglas High School in the nearby town of Douglas, Ariz., and on the Magoffin Ranch, near the refuge. They introduced leopard frogs to new sites where bullfrogs - which are voracious predators on the leopard frogs - were absent. Leopard frogs increased in number exponentially, but in 1997, a rapid, mysterious and alarming die-off of leopard frogs occurred at some of the sites, Schwalbe said. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"We knew then that non-native species were not the only cause of leopard frog decline,\" said Phil Rosen, the University of Arizona researcher who found that some of the dying and dead frogs at the study sites had a chytrid fungal skin infection that was identified microscopically by Greg Bradley, a veterinary pathologist at the university&rsquo;s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

The City of Redding is located about four miles downstream of Keswick Dam. Alpers said that although the City of Redding gets its drinking water from the Sacramento River, the metals from Iron Mountain do not pose a significant threat to this water supply because of dilution effects and the water treatment plant. Fish are much more sensitive than humans to trace metals such as copper and zinc, and water-quality criteria for wildlife, that are enforced by the Regional Water Quality Board and the EPA, are much more stringent than criteria for drinking water, in the case of these metals. In the event of an uncontrolled release of metal-rich drainage from iron Mountain, the City of Redding has a contingency plan to switch to alternate ground-water sources. <\/p>\r\n<p>In the course of their research at Iron Mountain, Nordstrom and Alpers, in cooperation with colleagues from the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada, developed a new method for measuring negative pH values in highly concentrated acid mine waters. The most acidic waters ever recorded were sampled by the USGS scientists in 1990 and 1991, but it took several years for them to find a way to accurately quantify the extreme acidity and to have the concept of negative pH accepted by the scientific community. <\/p>\r\n<p>Chemistry textbooks usually describe pH values as ranging from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values of pH near 0 are highly acidic, becoming less acidic and more alkaline at the higher numbers. Because pH is measured on a logarithmic scale, each declining unit represents 10 times more acidity. Alpers said several of the drip-water samples at Iron Mountain had pH values below zero, indicating hydrogen ion activities greater than one. The lowest pH found at the site was -3.6. <\/p>\r\n<p>Alpers and other members of the underground sampling team had to contend with dangerous conditions in the mine workings. The temperature was more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, humidity approached 100 percent, random rock falls from the 40-foot ceiling were a common occurrence, and extremely acid water was dripping everywhere. Huge stalacite-stalagmite structures, composed of rhomboclase and other iron sulfate minerals, spanned from floor to ceiling in the mine opening, where the most acidic waters were found. Rhomboclase, a rare mineral, is a solid form of sulfuric acid and ferric iron sulfate. <\/p>\r\n<p>To put the hydrology of the Iron Mountain site in context, the drip rate of the negative pH waters found in the Richmond Mine is on the order of less than one gallon per minute, whereas the overall flow rate of the discharge from the Richmond Mine ranges from 20 to more than 1,000 gal","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"953701200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Media Advisory: USGS Information Available on Recent MTBE Risk Findings","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>As many as 9,000 community water wells in 31 states may be at risk for contamination <\/p>\n<p><b>What:<\/b> A new study from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Oregon Graduate Institute shows that as many as 9,000 community water wells in 31 states may be affected by contamination from the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) due to their proximity to leaking underground storage tanks.

Traces of the fault have never been observed, but erratic exposures of the Merced sedimentary formation, from the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco Bay, have led some geologists to believe that these sediments may have been disturbed by a fault. Even when Manuel Bonilla, of the USGS in Menlo Park, first mapped the fault in 1964, he referred to it as \"hypothetical,\" and continued to do so on two subsequent maps published by the USGS in 1965 and 1971. <\/p>\r\n<p>Hypothetical or not, in 1997, when Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) planners began to explore the possibility of extending BART to San Francisco International Airport, they needed to know, once and for all, whether or not there was a San Bruno fault, and if so, would it become active enough to affect the proposed rail line. <\/p>\r\n<p>In order to answer that question, Bonilla and his fellow USGS scientists went beyond field observations and conventional geologic mapping to determine the extent of the Merced formation and the shape of the Franciscan bedrock basin in which it lies. A high-resolution aeromagnetic survey was flown to provide information on concealed faults of the San Andreas system. The magnetic characteristics of the Franciscan bedrock are ideal for this type of survey, during which a sensitive magnet, attached like a stinger to the underbelly of a low-flying airplane, measures irregularities of magnetism in buried formations. Where the magnetism of a buried unit changes abruptly, it indicates that fault movement may have disturbed the original layers of that formation. The San Bruno aeromagnetic survey showed the San Andreas and other faults on the San Francisco Peninsula, but none where the San Bruno fault was supposed to be. <\/p>\r\n<p>They also used another indirect method to look for the fault-precise measurements of the pull of gravity. The pull of gravity at the ground surface is stronger where dense bedrock is close to the surface than it is where the bedrock is covered by much less dense sediments like the Merced Formation. Thus, an abrupt difference in depth to bedrock, such as expected from the San Bruno fault, can be readily detected. This method, too, showed no evidence for the fault. <\/p>\r\n<p>Although small earthquakes (magnitude to 2.0) occurred in the 20th century, northwest of Lake Merced, near the presumed trace of the fault, the USGS scientists attribute those earthquakes to activity on a right-step in the San Andreas fault, rather than the hypothetical San Bruno fault.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Editors: Interviews with any of the five USGS scientists involved in the study of the San Bruno fault may be arranged by calling the USGS Public Affairs Office at 650-329-4000.

Groat warned that continued below-normal streamflow and low ground-water levels may signal a return of last summer&rsquo;s drought. <\/p>\r\n<p>Based on data from the USGS network of more than 7,000 streamgages nationwide, there are some areas of the country -- particularly east of the Mississippi River -- where streamflows are at record-low flows for this time of year. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"This is the time of year where streamflow conditions should be about normal, but in the eastern half of the country, we&rsquo;re anywhere but that.\" Groat said. \"We should be seeing ground-water recharge taking place now and we&rsquo;re not seeing that either.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>There is a slightly different phenomenon occurring from last year&rsquo;s drought. Now, the drought is moving west, clearly into the Appalachians and the southeast, he said. These are areas that did not receive recharge from the last year&rsquo;s busy hurricane season like the eastern seaboard did. USGS scientists are also seeing near record-low streamflows in the Ohio Valley, the center of the Midwest, the Lower Mississippi River Basin and into the southeast. <\/p>\r\n<p>Groat joined Commerce Secretary William Daley, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, NOAA Administrator James Baker and National Weather Service Director Jack Kelly at the press conference to discuss the spring and summer drought forecast. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Think of it as not having enough money to put into the bank,\" Groat said. \"In some areas of the country, we don&rsquo;t have enough water now to put into our groundwater bank. This is the time of year we are supposed to be recharging our savings -- our groundwater and reservoirs. That hasn&rsquo;t happened this winter and so we don&rsquo;t have the buffer we need when we start making withdrawals in the summer. When our dry summer hits, we may not have enough in savings to get through without problems.

According to the USGS biologists who discovered this new population in December, the eels appear to represent a separate introduction from previously discovered swamp eel populations in Georgia, north Miami, and Tampa because of the widely separated ranges and apparent genetic differences between the Homestead population and the north Miami and Georgia populations. \r\n<p>The eels have not been found within Everglades National Park, although the latest discovery places the eels within a kilometer of the park boundary, said Dr. John Curnutt, a biologist with the USGS Florida Caribbean Science Center in Miami, who is coordinating the monitoring studies of this new population. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"These fishes have the attributes necessary to successfully invade and colonize the Everglades and other freshwater southeastern wetlands, where they could adversely affect native fishes, amphibians and invertebrates through predation,\" said Curnutt. \"They have the potential to disrupt food webs, eat native species, and compete with native fish and wading birds for food. The interconnectedness of the waterways and the eel&rsquo;s biology pose substantial risks of the species becoming established in the Everglades.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Biologists have been monitoring the distribution of this new population since its discovery in December and are studying the effects on native species of the swamp eels discovered last year in Florida. <\/p>\r\n<p>Of particular concern to scientists and resource managers is that these highly adaptable eels have the ability to thrive in a wide variety of natural habitats and in adverse conditions. In addition to marsh and swamp habitats, Curnutt said the fish survives quite well in ponds, canals, roadside ditches and rice fields &mdash; \"just about any freshwater habitat with a few inches of water.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Another trait that could help these fish successful colonize southeastern waterways is that swamp eels are air breathers, enabling them to survive long dry spells. In fact, said Curnutt, their use of air is so efficient that the eels can readily migrate short distances across land from one water body to another. In addition, the eels can live easily in even a few inches of water, especially in warm water. <\/p>\r\n<p>Swamp eels, which reach lengths of three feet or more, are predators, feeding on animals such as worms, insects, shrimp, crayfish and other fishes and frogs. Yet, said Curnutt, the eels are also able to survive weeks &mdash; and possibly months &mdash; without food. The eels are highly secretive, with most of their activities occurring at night. In the day, the fishes hide in thick aquatic vegetation or in small burrows and crevices along the water&rsquo;s edge. In many populations, all young are hatched as females, and then, after spending part of their life as females, some eels transform into large males. <\/p>\r\n<p>At first, said Curnutt, biologists believed that the Homestead population represented a range expansion by animals from the population known to exist around the Miami-Dade\/Broward County line, but recently completed genetic tests at Florida International University indicate that the Homestead population differs geneti","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Florida"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"952059600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169708"},{"tid":"169472"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Tennis Ball Time at the USGS","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>If certain employees of the U.S. Geological Survey are begging for used tennis balls, it must mean that something big is brewing.

But this new USGS study also finds that within these regions there are large differences in the percentage of nitrogen reaching the Gulf, depending on the relation of the location of nitrogen sources to streams of different sizes in the watershed. <\/p>\n<p>The study finds that the rates of nitrogen reaching the Gulf from upstream areas near large rivers in such states as Ohio and Minnesota are much higher than those in neighboring areas near small streams. Moreover, areas near large rivers in these same states, located more than 1,500 miles from the Gulf, also deliver more nitrogen to the Gulf than areas near small streams in the states of Mississippi and Arkansas, located only a few hundred miles from the Gulf. <\/p>\r\n<p>Previously it was not clear whether a unit of nitrogen released in different areas of the Mississippi River drainage basin has an equal chance of reaching the Gulf. It had generally been assumed that the percentage of nitrogen traveling downstream to the Gulf decreased as the distance increased. However, this study, to be published in the February 17 issue of Nature, finds that nitrogen pollution is naturally removed from water much more rapidly in small streams than in large rivers. As a result, nitrogen delivery from point and nonpoint sources in a stream drainage basin is not simply a function of the distance between the Gulf and the nitrogen source, but a function of the amount of time the nitrogen travels through small streams. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"We found that nitrogen is naturally removed from small streams much more quickly than in large rivers, such as the Mississippi River and its major tributaries,\" said USGS scientist Richard Alexander, one of the authors of the study. \"One of the most important ways that nitrogen is removed from water in the bottom sediments of streams is through a natural process called denitrification, where nitrogen is converted by bacteria to harmless nitrogen gas and vented to the atmosphere.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The amount of nitrogen removed from water depends on the amount of water in contact with bottom sediments. Because water in small, shallow streams has more contact with the bottom sediments than water in deep, large rivers, more nitrogen is expected to be removed in smaller streams than larger rivers. The results of this study strongly support this theory. <\/p>\r\n<p>Nitrogen increases in the Mississippi River have been cited as the leading cause of eutrophication (excessive algal growth) and chronic hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) in Louisiana coastal waters and the Gulf of Mexico during the latter half of the 20th century. This area of oxygen-depleted waters is the largest in the western Atlantic Ocean. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"The spring inflow of nitrogen-enriched waters from the Mississippi River into the poorly mixed, shallow Gulf waters causes excessive algal production,\" Alexander explained. \"Then, the decay of the algae depletes the oxygen in the water, causing bottom-dwelling organisms to die and stressing the fishing resources in the Gulf.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The percentage of stream nitrogen reaching the Gulf of Mexico from all areas in the Mississippi River drainage basin is illustrated in a color map at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/themes\/nature.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/themes\/nature.html<\/a>. In this map, colors representing the percentage of nitrogen reaching the Gulf of Mexico form a dendritic pattern, similar to the veins of a leaf, with the largest percentage near the Mississippi, Ohio, and lower Missouri River valleys. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS study used data from 374 monitoring stations located on rivers and streams in the United States, including 123 stations in the Mississippi River basin, to quantify the rates at which nitrogen is removed from channels by natural processes. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"950677200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170318"},{"tid":"168993"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Meeting the Challenges of Urban Growth: A National Issue","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><b>MEDIA ADVISORY<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>What:<\/b> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Congressional briefing on \"Meeting the Challenges of Urban Growth\" that highlights how science information and decision support tools are helping communities around the country balance population growth and economic development with maintaining a healthy environment. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>When:<\/b> February 17, 2000 10:00-11:00 a.m. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Where:<\/b> Room 311 Cannon House Office Building, 1st &amp; Independence Ave., SE <\/p>\r\n<p>Meeting the Challenges of Urban Growth is the second in a series of Congressional briefing sponsored by the USGS and Representative Tom Davis that highlights how earth and biological science information used by decision makers to make communities safer and healthier.

Reliance on water treatment plants and chlorination is important to safe drinking water but it is clear that strategies must go beyond treatment to protection of water sources. Increasing urbanization of land used as sources of drinking water, microbial pathogens resistant to chlorination, and proliferation of new synthetic chemical compounds that may have adverse health effects, are challenging the effectiveness of treatment technology. The 21st century will see increased awareness that drinking water supplies are whole systems that include source-water areas, ground-water wells and surface-water intakes, treatment plants and distribution systems. USGS scientists are helping communities protect their drinking water sources by designing computer models and other tools and conducting research to help communities identify, manage, and protect source water areas.

Increasing knowledge of the close relationship between human activities and the environment has made it clear that the chemical compounds we use can find their way into the nation&rsquo;s water resources. Preliminary results from a USGS study indicate that many compounds commonly used in everyday life are turning up at very low concentrations in streams across the country. Examples of some of the compounds found to date include acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine, cotinine (a nicotine metabolite), 17b-estradiol (a hormone), and sulfamethoxazole (an antibiotic). For many of these compounds, the USGS study will provide the earliest data on their environmental occurrence in the nation. The impacts of these chemicals on humans or aquatic life, at the low concentrations they are found in the environment, are generally unknown, but the USGS is working in partnership with health and environmental science agencies as the study proceeds.

Written records of the damage in Japan pinpoint the earthquake to the evening of January 26, 1700. <\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists now call the event the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. They estimate its size as magnitude 9. <\/p>\r\n<p>Only three earthquakes of magnitude 9 or larger occurred in the twentieth century. The largest, of magnitude 9.5, struck Chile in 1960. Second-largest was the 9.2 quake that hit Alaska in 1964. By comparison, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was not quite magnitude 8. <\/p>\r\n<p>The very existence of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake was unknown just 20 years ago. The earthquake&rsquo;s discovery resulted from scientific sleuthing in the United States, Canada, and Japan. <\/p>\r\n<p>An early breakthrough came in 1987, when U.S. Geological Survey geologist Brian Atwater reported geological traces of giant earthquakes along Washington&rsquo;s Pacific coast. These traces include groves of trees that were killed when an earthquake lowered forests into salt water. <\/p>\r\n<p>Another important clue was reported a few years later, when the earthquake was dated to the decades between 1680 and 1720. This clue came from radiocarbon tests by Minze Stuiver of the University of Washington. <\/p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile in Japan, several researchers were following these developments. They consulted their nation&rsquo;s archives of old writings about earthquakes and tsunamis. For the period between 1680 and 1720 they found one orphan tsunami that could have come from Cascadia. That tsunami occurred in January 1700. <\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, a smoking gun was found in the groves of killed trees on the Washington coast. Using annual growth rings in the trees, David Yamaguchi of Seattle and Gordon Jacoby of Columbia University showed that the trees lived through the 1699 growing season but were dead by the following spring -- exactly the dates expected if the earthquake occurred in January 1700. <\/p>\r\n<p>This detective story is part of an special public program, Wednesday evening, January 26, in Seattle.

The field can undergo large and rapid fluctuations due to the interaction of charged particles ejected by the Sun that collide with the geomagnetic field. These disturbances are known as \"geomagnetic storms,\" and can cause power blackouts, disruptions in communications, satellite failures, and other hazardous effects. These solar ejections, traveling at more than a million miles an hour, are associated with sunspots, whose number increase and decrease over an 11-year cycle. The number of geomagnetic storms therefore increases and decreases in concert with that cycle. The next peak in sunspot activity is expected to occur in early 2000 - perhaps just in time for the arrival of the New Year. \r\n<p>The last great magnetic storm occurred exactly 11 years ago this coming March 13 at 3 a.m. EST. That storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Quebec power system in Canada, leaving about 6 million people without power. If the storm had struck a few hours later than it did, the blackout would likely have been much worse because of the heavier power consumption during daytime hours. \r\n<p>Magnetic storms are not rare, but great storms like this are. \r\n<p>\"During the sunspot maximum we are going through now, smaller storms can occur rather frequently - even several times a week. Though it is unlikely that a really large storm will hit just as the New Year arrives, it could happen, and if it does, the results might complicate the situation with Y2K,\" said Don Herzog, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). \r\n<p>If a magnetic storm does strike during the transition into the new millennium, the USGS is prepared to continue the supply of geomagnetic data to its customers. \r\n<p>The USGS operates a network of 13 magnetic observatories that continuously monitor the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. The USGS provides this valuable geomagnetic data to a wide variety of users and organizations that can be affected by a geomagnetic storm. The data are collected in near-real time via satellite to a downlink center located in Golden, Colo. They are then sent to the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Space Command Center for use in their operational models that characterize the near-space environment surrounding the Earth, and to NOAA&rsquo;s Space Environment Center for distribution to their extensive customer list. \r\n<p>The geomagnetic data are also shared with agencies comparable to the USGS in other countries including Canada, Japan, France, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and others as part of an international organization called INTERMAGNET. The data are made available to the worldwide community via the World Wide Web (<a href=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov<\/a>) and by e-mail request. \r\n<p>In addition to providing data to its customers, the USGS also produces models of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field that are used in a host of applications, including GPS receivers, military and civilian navigational systems, and in research for studies of the effects of geomagnetic storms on the ionosphere, atmosphere, and near-space environment.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"946357200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169254"},{"tid":"169489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Kathryn Clement Is Named USGS Deputy Director","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->U.S. Geological Survey Director Charles Groat today announced his intent to appoint Kathryn Clement as USGS Deputy Director effective January 1, 2000.<!--introend--> Clement is currently Associate Division Chief for Operations of USGS&rsquo; National Mapping Division. \n<p>\"Kathy is a results-oriented leader with strong organizational skills.

Beginning in January 2000, the USGS Earthquake Hazards Team, in cooperation the seismographic Station at UC Berkeley, will begin installing 60-70 seismograph stations in the core urban areas of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley. <!--introend-->\n<p>In a partnership with Microsoft and CartaInc, a Bay area WEB development company, the USGS and UC Berkeley have established a Website for the experiment at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osfusa.com\">http:\/\/www.osfusa.com<\/a>. This Website will keep the public informed about the experiment, and will allow people to volunteer to host a seismograph in their back yard for a period of about six months. Dr. Alan Lindh, who is managing the project, is extremely grateful for the over 900 responses the site has received since the Website came on line a week ago, and in some areas there are now sufficient potential sites to choose from. In some areas, however, especially in Chinatown, Hunters Point, Mission Bay and Potrero Hill, more sites are needed. \r\n<p>Residents, small businesses, commercial establishments, or anyone with a small patch of open ground where a small seismograph could be installed, are urged to check out the Website for more information. Residents who are willing to have a seismometer placed on their property can complete and submit an online volunteer form. Website visitors can also view maps that highlight information about the study, and can go to related earthquake sites to obtain more information about earthquakes and what they can do to prepare for them. \r\n<p>Installing a seismometer in a backyard will involve digging a small hole, and burying the seismometers. The seismograph itself will be installed in a plastic tub somewhere nearby, and can be hidden behind a bush, in a side yard, a small shed, or anywhere else that is convenient. Ideally, the backyard would be fenced to discourage \"tinkering\" by unauthorized persons, but would not be guarded by a dog, as USGS technicians will need to visit the site about once a month to retrieve the data. The use of a nearby electrical outlet will be necessary, although the small amount of power used will be infinitesimal. \r\n<p>The San Francisco\/Oakland monitoring project is patterned after the backyard seismometer network established by Lindh in San Jose in 1998. During that project, 40 seismometers were placed in backyards in San Jose and adjacent areas for five months. Data gleaned from the new project will be used for several scientific purposes, including building a better computer model of the Bay Area for modeling strong ground motion and estimating the site-amplification effects. \r\n<p>\"The main thrust of this is to get a better handle on the structure of the rocks below the city,\" Lindh said. \"By putting seismometers on basically every unit, we&rsquo;ll be able to build a three-dimensional model of what the earth looks like underneath San Francisco and Oakland, and that will help computer modelers build better models of the shaking that will occur during a major earthquake.\" \r\n<p>The results of the study will be used to predict which parts of the cities, based on the makeup of the earth beneath them, are likely to receive the most damage during the next sizeable earthquake, which has a two- thirds chance of happening within the next 30 years, according to Lindh. \"Homeowners will be able to use the information to renovate their homes, and planning officials will be able to construct buildings, bridges, and transportation and utility infrastructures that are more resistant to earthquakes. Over the long-run, it will influence the way buildings are constructed,\" Lindh said. \"It may take five to 10 years or more, but eventually each new piece of the puzzle ends up as part of the building codes and the planning regulations.\" \r\n<p>For the Internet and computer support of the project, the USGS has established a partnership with Microsoft and CartaInc.

McLean, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., briefed the committee on the role of native bird populations and other wildlife in the emergence of West Nile virus in the United States. Detection of the virus in birds and other animal species provides critical information to public health agencies tracking the infection in people. \r\n<p>\"The high mortality in crows and other bird species is unusual for these viruses,\" McLean said. \"This suggests that this virus is more virulent to our native birds or it may represent a new, more virulent strain of the virus.\" \r\n<p>Resident and migratory birds may play an important role in natural transmission of the virus and in maintaining the virus in the United States, McLean testified. \"Migratory birds could also spread the virus to other states outside of the New York City area,\" he said. \"Enhanced monitoring through surveillance for early, rapid detection of West Nile virus in states outside the affected area will be important to guide prevention measures.\" \r\n<p>The emergence of West Nile virus in the United States, which led to the deaths of seven people from West Nile encephalitis, has brought together the combined expertise and resources of many federal and state agencies along the eastern seaboard. Several federal and state agencies and private groups are searching for stored human and animal specimens that were collected prior to 1999 in order to test them for the presence of West Nile virus. These specimens are also being tested for antibodies to determine if the virus was present in the United States before the 1999 outbreak. Results from these investigations should provide more insight into how, where and when the virus was introduced, McLean noted. \r\n<p>McLean, who received his Ph.D. at Penn State University in 1966, and has 30 years of experience with wildlife diseases, also discussed the activities and efforts of the USGS in investigating the wildlife aspects of this virus. \"As of early November, 392 birds have been tested by USGS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 192 were positive for West Nile virus,\" McLean said. \"The virus has infected at least 20 species of birds, including exotic and native birds at zoos, and about four species of mosquitoes. But, it is difficult to assess how many birds have died from this disease.\" \r\n<p>USGS, CDC, U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies have heightened wildlife surveillance for detection of West Nile virus, and they have expanded monitoring to other Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. McLean assured the committee, \"We are continuing to collaborate on enhanced surveillance and to determine what specific surveillance methods will work best for each region.\" \r\n<p>McLean believes that native bird populations will play a key role in the investigation of the long-term impacts of the West Nile virus in the United States. He added, \"Additional research is needed in order to determine if wildlife, mosquito or both populations in the affected areas can maintain the virus in New York and other states and serve as an over wintering source for resurgence next summer.\" \r\n<p>For more information on West Nile virus, see the following webpages: \r\n<p><b>USGS Home Page on West Nile Virus<\/b><br>http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/west_nile_virus.html<br><br>\r\n<p><b>USGS Fact Sheet on West Nile Virus<\/b><br>http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/wnvfactsheet.html<br><br><b>USGS National Wildlife Health Center and related web pages<\/b><br>http:\/\/www.umesc.usgs.gov\/nwhchome.html<br>http:\/\/www.umesc.usgs.gov\/http_","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"945147600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170250"},{"tid":"170203"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Make Tracks to USGS for the Holidays","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Train enthusiasts!

Many people had thought that it took hundreds or thousands of years for water and any contaminants in water to seep down to water table in the High Plains aquifer; because there is little rainfall, the water table is commonly more than 200 feet below land surface, and there are layers of naturally-cemented sand and gravel below soils in much of the region. A recently published computer model of the aquifer indicates that the volume of recharge is relatively small, less than one inch per year, but this new data indicate that water and entrained contaminants may reach the water table in parts of the aquifer sooner than previously believed.

Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen that is harmless at low concentrations.

The good news is, with the exception of American crows, there were only a few individual birds from each respective species thattested positive. It is still too early to tell if this is because they are not as susceptible or they were not as readily observed as crows.\" \r\n<p>Monitoring mortality in American crows is especially important because crows appear to be highly sensitive to the virus. Since many crows normally travel less than 200 miles they can act as sentinels for local transmission of the disease. \r\n<p>\"At this time it is difficult to assess how many birds have died from this disease. While some of the affected areas have reported very high bird mortality, especially in crows, a number of the birds have died from other causes,\" said USGS wildlife disease specialist Linda Glaser. \"About 49percent of the 392 birds tested by the USGS and CDC have tested positive for West Nile virus.\" \r\n<p>McLean and his team of USGS biologists have been taking blood samples from migratory and non-migratory birds in the New York area to get a sense of the extent that bird populations and various species were exposed to thevirus. \"This information, in addition to being shared with the CDC, will be used in establishing an effective surveillance network to track the virus and ultimately learn how it could impact our native bird populations,\" saidMcLean. \r\n<p>There is still much that is unknown about the ecology of the virus and how it will respond to its new environment in the United States. \"Once a bird is infected, the virus can be transmitted to mosquitoes only for about 4 to 5 days.

Because many people obtain their drinking water from aquifers, monitoring and protection of these aquifers are needed.\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS study assessed the water quality in the aquifer and not at the tap. Many types of wells were sampled including monitoring, domestic and public supply wells. Looking at the nation&rsquo;s ground water as a whole, the USGS estimates that about 7 percent of the resource contains at least one VOC, but the levels typically do not exceed drinking water criteria. Ground water in these areas is the source of drinking water for about 42 million people. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>VOCs were more commonly detected in urban areas than rural areas. When VOCs were detected in the samples, they most commonly occur with other VOCs. In urban areas, about half of the sampled wells had at least one VOC and about 30 percent had two or more VOCs. In rural areas, about 15 percent of the wells had one VOC and 6 percent had two or more VOCs. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\"One common pattern that the USGS is seeing in its assessment of the quality of the Nation&rsquo;s water is that chemical compounds occur in mixtures, a finding which is reinforced by this study of ground water aquifers for drinking water supply,\" Zogorski said. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established drinking-water criteria and monitoring requirements for community water systems for 27 VOCs because of health concerns. The EPA criteria are four times more likely to be exceeded in urban areas than in rural areas. Chlorination of public water, the most common treatment method, generally does not reduce VOC concentrations. However, treatment facilities routinely monitor for VOCs and must use other treatment methods, such as aeration, if levels get above allowable limits. Such is not the case with private wells. (EPA criteria are based on exposure to a single VOC in drinking water, not the mixture of VOCs found in the source aquifers in the USGS study.) \r\n<p>The USGS collected samples from almost 3,000 wells nationwide between 1985-1995. The lowest concentration detected in the wells sampled was 0.2 micrograms per liter (2 parts per billion), which is lower than what is reported by many public water supplies for finished drinking water. The ability of the USGS to \"detect\" these compounds in water samples does not automatically translate into impacts on human or aquatic health. (The level of accuracy demanded by the USGS to assess the effects on water quality is a minute amount - sometimes parts per trillion - which is well below the threshold used for setting standards and guidelines for protection of human and aquatic health.) \r\n<p>\r\n<p>In urban and rural wells in the USGS study, the four most frequently detected compounds, in order, were chloroform, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and trichloroethene (TCE).

In conjunction with her husband and colleague, Mark Zoback, of the Geophysics Department at Stanford University, she developed methodologies for determining the present-day distribution of forces acting on the earth&rsquo;s crust from a variety of data and observations. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>&gt;From 1986 to 1992, Zoback lead the World Stress Map project, an international collaboration of 40 scientists from 30 different countries, which compiled and interpreted a global database on present day stresses in the earth&rsquo;s crust. This work demonstrated that broad regions in the interior of most tectonic plates are subjected to relatively uniform stresses that result from the same forces that cause plate motion. These findings eliminated local stress perturbations as the cause of \"intraplate\" earthquakes, such as those that struck New Madrid, Mo., in 1811-1812. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>In 1987, Zoback was the recipient of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Macelwane Award for \"significant contributions to the geophysical sciences by a young scientist of outstanding ability. In 1990- 1991 Zoback was the recipient of the USGS G.K. Gilbert fellowship which allowed her to spend a year at Karlsruhe University, Germany, working with colleagues there and elsewhere in Europe on analyses of stresses responsible for intraplate seismicity. In 1995 she was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Zoback has served on numerous internal USGS advisory committees as well as national and international scientific review and advisory panels. She was one of 17 scientific experts selected by the National Research Council to evaluate the potential for ground water to rise to the level of the proposed high-level radioactive waste repository proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nev., and currently serves on the Board on Radioactive Waste Management. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Zoback is a fellow of both the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the AGU. She has previously served GSA as councillor (1986-1988), president of the Cordilleran section (1989-1990), and chair of the geophysics division (1987-1988). She has served as president of the AGU tectonophysics section and is a member of its governing council. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Zoback and her husband, Mark, live in Palo Alto, Calif., with their two children, Eli, 17, and Megan, 14.

In the report, USGS geographer Molly Maupin describes methods that she and other USGS scientists used to calculate the pccs and said, \"Because pccs are tailored to each site, we can provide cost savings to monitoring programs because fewer visits and less equipment are needed.\" \n<p>Currently, pumped withdrawals from 32 sites along the Snake River between Upper Salmon Falls and Swan Falls Dams in southwestern Idaho compose most of the irrigation-water diversions from that reach of the river. Those pumps lift water as high as 745 feet to irrigate croplands on plateaus north and south of the river in parts of Elmore, Twin Falls, and Owyhee Counties. Average withdrawals at measured pump sites during 1990-95 ranged from 1,120 to 44,480 acre-feet of water, depending on how large and how many pumps were present. The USGS, through a cooperative study with the Idaho Department of Water Resources, has continuously measured withdrawals at some sites for as many as 14 years, but diminishing financial resources has created a need to determine pumped withdrawals by other means. \r\n<p>So, in 1998, as part of its Water-Use Program, the USGS inventoried all pump sites in the study area and calculated a pcc for each site. A pcc describes the amount of energy a pump site uses to lift an acre-foot of water. By using this coefficient and annual electrical power records, future withdrawals at sites that are no longer measured can be determined. \r\n<p>The USGS reports irrigation withdrawals from surface-water sources as part of its Water-Use Program.

Lovich and ecologist Dr. David Bainbridge of the United States International University in \"Anthropogenic degradation of the southern California desert ecosystem and prospects for natural recovery and restoration.\" Lovich and Bainbridge based their conclusions on the first comprehensive examination of the scientific literature on human impacts in Southern California deserts, a review of more than 150 studies by university and government scientists. \r\n<p>\"The legacy of human occupancy and use has left indelible marks in the desert, for better or worse,\" Lovich said. \"The desert is a fragile ecosystem. It is important to recognize the consequences of our actions. The information contained in this study can help to guide managers of these lands, while educating the public that enjoys them.\" \r\n<p>The Mojave Desert includes portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Inyo and Kern counties, while the Colorado Desert extends through parts of Riverside and Imperial counties. Together, the two deserts cover more than 38,000 square miles -- larger than the state of Indiana. \r\n<p>Because of high temperatures, intense sun, strong winds, low soil fertility and minimal rainfall, natural restoration of the desert ecosystem is extremely slow, said Bainbridge. \"The desert looks tough but it is extremely vulnerable to damage,\" Bainbridge said. \"While it may appear that driving on the bare areas between plants will do no harm, we now know that the plant roots extend throughout these bare areas and that crushing the soil will cause damage that is very hard to fix.\" \r\n<p>However, Lovich and Bainbridge said there is room in the desert to support a variety of human needs and preserve wide swaths in their natural state. \"This is not to say that all forms of land use are incompatible with conservation of healthy functioning desert ecosystems,\" Lovich said. \r\n<p>\"The important lesson from the many studies of desert recovery and restoration is to avoid damage rather than to fix it,\" Bainbridge said. \"Natural recovery may take hundreds or thousands of years and even with intensive restoration work, recovery can take many years.\" \r\n<p>A number of human-related activities are documented in research reviewed by Lovich and Bainbridge: \r\n<p>-- Recreational use of off-road vehicles such as motorcycles and dune buggies compacts the soil, reducing its ability to absorb water, makes the landscape more susceptible to wind and water erosion, destroys vegetation and reduces lizard populations. Lovich and Bainbridge write that off-road vehicle use is perhaps the most damaging current human activity in the desert and estimate it would take centuries for those areas to completely recover. A major effort to aid recovery of areas affected by off-road vehicle use could cost more than $1 billion, Bainbridge and Lovich report. \r\n<p>-- Invasions by non-native plants -- made possible by human-caused habitat destruction that allows exotic species to colonize -- not only displace native plants, but also increase the fire risk. Particulate air pollution transported to the deserts can increase the nitrogen content of soil, due to \"dryfall\" of pollutants to the ground, further enhancing non-native plant species by providing additional nutrients to them. \r\n<p>-- Construction of overhead power transmission lines nearly destroys plant cover and soil conditions in the immediate area.

Burruss will present his findings on the feasibility of this technique, called \"geologic sequestration,\" at the 111th Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America scheduled for Oct. 24-28 in Denver, Colorado. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\"Depleted oil and gas reservoirs can be thought of as empty containers that could be filled with carbon dioxide,\" says Burruss, who points out that reservoirs are natural traps that have contained gas for millions of years. \"Cumulative U.S. natural gas production through 1996 is 701 trillion cubic feet, and each year we produce about 20 trillion cubic feet more. Sequestering carbon dioxide from all U.S. coal-fired power plants, about a third of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions or slightly more than the Kyoto target, requires storage of 38 trillion cubic feet of carbon dioxide per year,\" Burruss explains. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Storage space, however, is only one of the challenges to managing carbon dioxide by sequestration.

In all, the team will make more than 50 dives to search for the abalone around Santa Catalina, San Clemente and Anacapa Islands and on Cortez, Tanner and Fansworth Banks, all prime white abalone habitat in the 1970s. \"We&rsquo;ve gone to some senior abalone divers to help learn specific spots that used to be productive for the fishery,\" said marine ecologist Kevin Lafferty of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). \r\n<p>If successful in their forays, the researchers will attempt to develop a captive-breeding program similar to those used to replenish imperiled terrestrial species. The group, informally known as the Abalone Restoration Consortium, has a proactive plan to help the vanishing marine invertebrate. Biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of California, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, working with the National Park Service and the California Department of Fish and Game, obtained federal funds to initiate a recovery program. \r\n<p>\"In addition to looking for white abalone in previously surveyed and unsurveyed areas, we will be recording data on habitat type, algae, the food of abalone, and the animals associated with this species so that we will have a better understanding of the distribution of suitable white abalone habitat for future restoration efforts,\" said abalone researcher Pete Haaker of California Department of Fish and Game. \r\n<p>If surveys confirm the mounting evidence that white abalone are indeed rare, the scientists will use two strategies to give the abalone a better chance for survival. The first approach will be to act as match-makers and simply get the abalone together in the first place - one of the biggest problems the abalone face is that they are too distant from each other to mate. Unlike more mobile animals, abalone are slow-moving creatures confined to a small area for their entire life. They reproduce by broadcasting their eggs and sperm into the seawater, and for fertilization to occur, the spawners need to be within three feet of a member of the opposite sex to effectively reproduce. Without neighbors, the remaining animals are effectively sterile, said Lafferty. \r\n<p>\"We will move isolated individuals next to each other to give them a chance to begin recovery on their own,\" Lafferty said. \"The most optimistic prediction is for a small-scale version of the baby boom that began when GI&rsquo;s returned to their brides after WWII. It&rsquo;s too bad the weather is so nasty in February or we could schedule this for Valentine&rsquo;s Day.\" \r\n<p>The second approach will be to bring white abalone back to several laboratories up and down the West coast for safe keeping and breeding.

The 12-foot vertical barrier created by the dam at Little Falls prevents the fish from reaching about 10 miles of historical prime breeding and spawning habitat above the dam. The inability of the fish to traverse the dam may have contributed to the decline of the American shad during the last several decades.

That is a question that safety-response and building-department officials have to answer in order to let occupants retrieve important possessions and business records, and to let contractors begin emergency repairs.<!--introend--> The obvious time to stay out of a building is immediately following the earthquake and until the aftershocks subside. But those aftershocks can last for days or weeks, as evidenced by recent large earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan. And so, the dilemma for earthquake survivors is knowing how soon they can go in and how long they may safely stay in the structure in order to search for survivors and retrieve possessions. \n<p>A recent \"tech brief\" prepared by the Applied Technology Council (ATC), in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, offers guidelines for entering earthquake-damaged buildings under emergency conditions. The guidelines are based on engineering research by ATC members and aftershock research by scientists at the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif. These guidelines are linked to the ATC post-earthquake building safety evaluation procedures referred to as ATC-20. These procedures are widely used by building departments to identify and \"flag\" unsafe buildings. \r\n<p>How soon a badly damaged but stable building can be entered and how long persons should stay in it, depends on the degree of damage to the building, the probability of and the size of aftershocks and the urgency of the need to enter, according to the brief&rsquo;s authors: Ronald P. Gallagher of Gallagher Associates; Chris D. Poland of Degenkolb Engineers; and Paul A. Reasenberg of the USGS. Tables that summarize the degree of risk for structures, based on the amount of initial damage and the probabilities for aftershocks, are included in the report, with color codes from yellow to red to denote the degrees of risk. \r\n<p>These ATC procedures, which are currently used by many jurisdictions in California, use color-coded tags on buildings as soon as safety inspectors and emergency-response personnel can make a preliminary survey of the buildings. Because such inspections cannot be done immediately on every structure, following a large earthquake, ATC TechBrief 2, \"Earthquake Aftershocks; Entering Damaged Buildilngs,\" offers the following guidelines about aftershocks and building safety: * The greater the magnitude of the earthquake and the stronger and longer the shaking, the greater the chances for strong and numerous aftershocks. \r\n<p>* If damage was heavy in the mainshock, the site is more likely to experience additional damage from aftershocks. \r\n<p>* A mainshock large enough to cause damage will probably be followed by several felt aftershocks within the first hour. \r\n<p>* Aftershocks decrease in number and magnitude, with time. Generally speaking, the second day will have approximately half the number of aftershocks as the first day and one-tenth as many on the tenth day. \r\n<p>* Except for life-saving rescues, entry into seriously damaged buildings should be avoided during the first 24 hours following a mainshock. \r\n<p>* If a damaged building must be entered following a strong mainshock, the time inside should be kept at a minimum. \r\n<p>* As a general rule, following a 6.5 or greater earthquake, three days should elapse before a damaged building should be occupied for up to eight hours at a time. Five additional days should elapse before the building is occupied for 24 hours at a time. \r\n<p>Scientists at the USGS began forecasting aftershocks, following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Most cities and towns are labeled, as are major highways and streets, to help orient users. Earthquake faults are shown in colors that indicate how recently the fault has been active. An inset diagram names all the major faults depicted on the map. \r\n<p>On \"Map A,\" circles of varying sizes are used to indicate the magnitudes and epicenters of the earthquakes. The color of the circles refers to the depth of the earthquakes, ranging from less than two kilometers (yellow) for very shallow quakes, to 15-plus kilometers (green) for some of the quakes. A quick glance at the map shows that most of the circles are red and pink, meaning that they were centered from five to 10 kilometers beneath the surface. Patterns of size and depth of earthquakes on certain faults can also be readily discerned. The Hayward and Calaveras faults, for instance, mostly generate earthquakes with magnitudes of less than 5.0, at depths of five to 10 kilometers. Earthquakes on the San Andreas fault, however, while having about the same magnitude as those on the Hayward and Calaveras, has produced deeper earthquakes that were centered between 12 and 15-plus kilometers beneath the surface. \r\n<p>In addition to the standard circles, the map portrays the direction of slip in an earthquake and the orientation of the fault on which it occurs through \"beachball\" symbols. These symbols represent the focal mechanism of many of the earthquakes. An accompanying block diagram illustrates the kinds of fault motion that are depicted by the beachball symbols, and an accompanying narrative explains the various mechanisms. Map \"B\" in the three-map set depicts and describes earthquake \"clusters,\" which include the mainshocks and aftershocks of 34 of the area&rsquo;s significant earthquakes. As on Map \"A,\" various size circles depict the earthquakes, but on this map various shades of the colors depict the time of the tremors, in hours after the first event in the series. The Loma Prieta earthquake, for instance, is depicted at its epicenter by a large blue circle. It is surrounded by circles depicting 7,000 aftershocks, all in various sizes and shades of blue, that occurred over a period of 627 days. Those aftershocks that occurred in the first 10 hours are in a slightly lighter shade of blue, with the lightest shades blue depicting those aftershocks that occurred more than 1,000 hours after the mainshock. The second-largest earthquake depicted on the map is the Morgan Hill earthquake that occurred on April 24, 1984, and generated 3,302 earthquakes over a 735-day period. In addition to depicting the epicenters of the earthquakes and aftershocks where they were felt on the surface, maps \"B\" and \"C\" show the earthquake data in vertical sections through the earth&rsquo;s crust. These earthquake cross-sections\" are drawn both along and across the major faults and reveal aspects of the fault geometry that are not apparent in map views. For example, cross-sections across the Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas fault reveal that the fault here dips to the southwest at an angle of about 75 degrees. \r\n<p>The map set should be of interest to science students and anyone else who wants to know more about how and where earthquakes happen in","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"939355200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Director Fills Two Pivotal Positions","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->U.S. Geological Survey Director Charles \"Chip\" Groat today announced the appointment of two top aides who will be central to more effectively communicating USGS mission and goals. <!--introend-->\n<p>Barbara Wainman, current chief of Congressional and Legislative Affairs for the Bureau of Land Management, will serve as chief of the newly formed Office of External Affairs.

(Alkalinity is a measure of the resistance of stream waters to acidity.) \r\n<p>Another contributing factor to the lack of stream alkalinity recovery at most of the sites, the USGS said, may be the declines in calcium and magnesium in precipitation over the 12 years from 1984 to 1996. Calcium and magnesium counteract the acidic compounds such as sulfuric and nitric acid in acid rain. \r\n<p>\"Our long-term monitoring data indicate that the reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions to the atmosphere are indeed lowering the sulfur concentrations in precipitation and stream water on a broad and regional scale in the Northeast,\" said David Clow, USGS researcher in Denver, Colo. \"That&rsquo;s the good news. However, increases in alkalinity have not been observed in most of these streams. And that&rsquo;s the bad news.\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS said the reason for the lack of widespread increases in alkalinity may be related to complex interactions among processes that control stream-water quality. For example, the acid-neutralizing compounds in precipitation are declining at the same time that acidic compounds in rain are going down. \"This &rsquo;down-and-down&rsquo; trend,\" Clow said, \"is probably due to overall reductions in particulates emitted to the atmosphere -- some of these particulates consist of &rsquo;good&rsquo; particulates that could neutralize acid.\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Secondly, after decades of acid rain falling in the Northeast, the supply of acid-neutralizing compounds in soils, such as calcium, may be depleted, the USGS said. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>A third complicating factor is that in areas where there is new growth in forests that are recovering from previous harvesting, the increase in trees, which need calcium to grow, may have an acidifying effect on forest soils. The fact that the diet of the trees is using the acid-neutralizing calcium could be offsetting the benefits from reductions in acid rain, the USGS said. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS has monitored stream-water chemistry at the Hydrologic Benchmark Network, a network of small headwater basins from the mid-1960&rsquo;s to 1997 and has measured precipitation chemistry through the interagency National Atmospheric Deposition Program from the early 1980&rsquo;s to the present.

DDE is an example of a metabolite of DDT. \r\n<p>The study adds to a growing body of research that indicates organochlorine pesticides can be transported long distances on air and sea currents and affect wildlife populations in remote and pristine areas, said Dr. Bob Anthony, lead author and a scientist at the USGS Oregon Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit in Corvallis, Ore. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Anthony&rsquo;s coauthors are Dr. Keith Miles and Dr. Jim Estes of the USGS Western Ecological Research Center in Sacramento, Calif., and Frank Isaacs of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Oregon State University. \r\n<p>\"The fact that elevated levels of pesticides such as DDT and DDE are more widely distributed than previously known raises concerns for the health of the Aleutian marine ecosystems where bald eagles forage,\" said Anthony. \r\n<p>Estes added, \"The top predators of these Alaskan ecosystems -- sea lions, seals and sea otters -- have declined substantially in the North Pacific Ocean over the last several decades. While overfishing and temperature regime shifts have been blamed, the role contaminants may play in these declines should be investigated further.\" \r\n<p>The Aleutian Archipelago in western Alaska marks the border between the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea and is made up of many islands that stretch between North America and Asia. It is also the westernmost nesting range of the bald eagle. In their study during the summers of 1993 and 1994, Anthony and his coauthors were surprised to find elevated levels of organochlorine contaminants in bald eagle eggs on all of the four islands they studied (Adak, Tanaga, Amchitka and Kiska), but particularly on the westernmost island, Kiska, where levels of mercury and DDE were significantly higher. The number of bald eagles produced per nest on Adak, Tanaga and Amchitka was comparable to healthy populations in the lower 48 states. The elevated levels of DDE on Kiska, however, were within the range known to cause reproductive problems in bald eagles, Anthony said. \r\n<p>\"We expected to find PCB&rsquo;s that may have been associated with the intensive military activity on all of the islands except Tanaga, but we didn&rsquo;t expect to find elevated DDT or its metabolites,\" said the USGS researcher. \"In fact, we thought that the eagles would have low or non-detectable concentrations of contaminants, possibly other than PCB&rsquo;s, since they are extremely remote from industrial or agricultural areas. We had hoped to study the effects of PCB&rsquo;s on bald eagles without our results being affected by the presence of elevated levels of other contaminants. What we found instead was both perplexing and disturbing. These contaminants appear to be traveling through oceanic or atmospheric currents to regions believed to be at little risk from such contamination.\" \r\n<p>The role of seabirds may also be important,\" suggested Keith Miles. \r\n<p>Although the researchers","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alaska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"938577600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169442"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Employees Rescue Flood Stranded Citizens in North Carolina","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->While navigating the treacherous floodwaters in North Carolina to measure the rising water caused by Hurricane Floyd, U.S. Geological Survey scientists rescued four citizens threatened by the storm. <!--introend-->\n<p>USGS scientists regularly monitor streamflow gaging stations built along riverbanks to ensure that the USGS flood-warning system is operating properly. In North Carolina, flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd&rsquo;s drenching rains severely damaged or destroyed 23 of those gaging stations. \r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when USGS senior hydrologic technician Bobby Ragland of Fuquay-Varina, N.C.; hydrologist Curtis Weaver of Raleigh, N.C.; and hydrologic technician David Fowler of Asheville, N.C., found themselves in a longboat, navigating flood waters as much as 20 feet above historic flood levels, using acoustic doppler current profilers to measure streamflow in areas where gages had become inoperative. \r\n<p>On Sunday, September 19, the three were taking stream measurements on the Tar River near Tarboro when they heard cries from a group of three men who had become separated from their vehicles and stranded by fast-rising flood waters that had risen to more than 10 feet deep. Streamflow measurements were immediately halted and the boat was maneuvered to the spot where the men were stranded. Weaver and Fowler quickly got out and volunteered their places in the boat to make room for the three men. Ragland passed out life jackets and shuttled the group across the murky floodwaters to their cars, then returned for his two coworkers. \r\n<p>\"The men were so thankful for our assistance,\" said Ragland. \"If we hadn&rsquo;t been in the area and picked them up, they could have been in a real bad situation.\" \r\n<p>The following Tuesday, September 21, the trio were taking measurements on the Neuse River near Kinston, when they found a man clinging to a boat, trying to tow it to shore. The man had ferried his belongings from his flooded house to dry land. However, as soon as he had stepped out of the boat, the strong current carried it 20 or 30 feet from shore. The man dove in and swam after the boat, but by the time he managed to get it into shallow water he was extremely exhausted. The three USGS scientists noticed a flooded gas station nearby and could smell gas fumes; they also noticed the man was losing strength and swallowing water with each gasp for air. Ragland quickly docked the longboat near the distressed man, and Weaver jumped into the shallow water and pulled the man and his boat to safety. \r\n<p>\"We received training in boat operations and safety and were taught to render help to the public in the event of an emergency,\" says Ragland. \r\n<p>Ragland, Weaver, and Fowler downplay the drama of their rescues, stressing they felt it was their obligation to assist these people.

After hurricanes Hugo, Fran, Bonnie and Bertha, the USGS documented large drops in dissolved-oxygen in the Waccamaw River and Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It took as long as four or five weeks before those waterways began recovery. This drop often occurs with the natural flushing of the extensive tidal marshes without additional nutrient loads. \r\n<p>To better document and understand the water chemistry of this type of event, USGS scientists will be collecting water-quality samples on a weekly or semi-weekly basis and analyze them for nutrients, bacteria, pesticides and metals. <b>North Carolina<\/b> The USGS is collecting water-quality samples at more than a dozen sites in the Tar and Neuse River Basins. The samples will be analyzed for bacteria, nutrients, metals, pesticides, dissolved oxygen and pH levels. \r\n<p>Contaminated water is one of the primary worries in the flooded eastern North Carolina. Wastewater-treatment plants have been flooded, as have septic systems and animal-waste lagoons. Rotting animal carcasses, chemical spills, and other contaminants add to this concern. Some reports put the animal death tolls as high as 100,000 dead hogs, 500,000 dead turkeys, and more than 2 million dead chickens in the eastern part of the state. \r\n<p>Scientists there are also grappling with washed out roads and flooded areas making their data collection efforts difficult and dangerous in some places.

Fire has not traditionally played a large role in organizing biological communities in these environments, where extremely arid conditions limit the density of vegetation. But in the deserts, too, alien grasses are now spreading, bringing rapid fire cycles with them. \r\n<p>Todd Esque, an ecologist with the USGS Western Ecological Research Center, says that although cheatgrass is not a big problem in the Mojave, other exotic species such as red brome are spreading fire through native communities that often have few evolved defenses against such disturbances. Esque and others are conducting detailed studies to better understand how increased fire size and frequency can affect desert ecosystems, and how native plants and animals can be protected. \"We&rsquo;re trying to take a holistic view of the fire-weed cycle,\" says Esque. \"We&rsquo;re looking at how fire changes nutrients in the soil, which changes the plants that are there, and in turn how animals respond to this dramatic change in habitat.\" \r\n<p>One of Esque&rsquo;s USGS collaborators, Dr. Matt Brooks, has studied recent historical changes in fire incidence and fire effects in the Mojave. Brooks says that while it is difficult to reconstruct long-term fire histories in desert systems, records from federal land management agencies do show an increase in Mojave Desert fires over the past two decades. Expanding human use of desert lands may be behind some of the increase, but Brooks says the pattern holds even in remote areas where fires are almost all lightning-caused. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\"The increase in fires seems to be due to the alien annual grasses,\" Brooks says. These grasses often build up during years of heavy rainfall and, unlike many native annuals, their dry stalks may remain rooted in the ground for many years after they die, providing a lasting fuel source. \r\n<p>Brooks and others have also found that native Mojave Desert plants are often particularly vulnerable to fire. Although some species do resprout after burning if the fire intensity is not too high, few can tolerate successive burns. \"If a second fire occurs before fire-damaged individuals have a chance to build back their above-ground, photosynthesizing biomass, they often die,\" says Brooks. \"The grass-fire cycle reduces the return interval between fires to the point where most native desert shrubs and bunchgrasses cannot survive.\" \r\n<p>Much of Esque&rsquo;s own work is focused on understanding the mechanisms of invasion. He is carrying out a set of manipulative experiments comparing deliberately burned and unburned plots. Previous researchers have found that in desert environments, seed-eating rodents and ants often play a large role in determining the structure and composition of the vegetation. By removing ants and rodents from some of his plots, Esque can assess how the presence or absence of seed-eaters, along with changes in the surface vegetation and soil nutrients caused by fire, interact to determine the course of weed invasion and habitat transformation. \r\n<p>Esque also takes advantage of the \"natural experiments\" provided by desert wildfires. In 1994, for example, he began a collaborative studies with USGS research ecologist Dr. Cecil Schwalbe, of the Western Ecological Research Center, on the effects through time of a large fire in Saguaro National Park in Arizona. In the aftermath of the fire, the researchers quickly assembled a field team and began a detailed census and monitoring effort both inside the burn area and on adjacent unburned lands. \r\n<p>In documenting the ensuing changes to the area&rsquo;s plant and animal life, the study has focused on two of the most representative species of the Sonoran Desert: the saguaro","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Arizona","California","Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"937540800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168875"},{"tid":"169015"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Studies Wildfire Ecology in the Western United States Part 1","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><b>Note to Reporters: Included are regional fire studies from the Sierra Nevada Forests; Interior and Coastal Shrublands; Mojave and Sonoran Deserts; and Southwest Forests<\/b> \n<p><b>Introduction<\/b> \r\n<p>Dr. Craig Allen, a USGS research ecologist with the Midcontinent Ecological Science Center, is speaking of the New Mexico forest ecosystems he knows best, but his words apply equally well to most of western North America. \"If you&rsquo;re trying to understand past and present patterns on the landscape,\" Allen says, \"first of all you need to know something about fire.\" \r\n<p><!--introstart-->From the northern Rocky Mountains to the Southwest borderlands, wildland fires have burned and rejuvenated western forests over the course of millennia. <!--introend-->And forests are not the only environments affected by fire; to a greater or lesser degree, fire influences the structure and dynamics of nearly all of the West&rsquo;s terrestrial ecosystems. In some, such as the chaparral brushlands of California, fire has been a strong force guiding the evolution of local plant life, and a constant regulator of ecological communities. In many desert habitats, on the other hand, fires have been far less frequent, but represent a more severe disturbance when they do occur. \r\n<p>Scientists and managers increasingly recognize the importance of fire as a natural component of ecological systems. But while fire is often a beneficial process, it is always, in the short term, a destructive one. The presence of fire has usually been seen as incompatible with both human land-use practices and aesthetics, and for over a century fires have been actively suppressed throughout the West. \r\n<p>The negative consequences of forest fire suppression can now be clearly seen. In many areas, disruption of the natural fire regime has produced overcrowded forests with vast accumulations of dry fuel. Blazes that break out under these conditions may be far more destructive than the normal fires of centuries past and are often extremely difficult or impossible to control. The absence of a regular fire cycle has also harmed many plant and animal species whose life histories are tightly linked to fire disturbance. \r\n<p>Across regions and among different forest types, the historical role of fire and the effects of recent fire suppression vary. And while fire suppression has fundamentally altered many forest ecosystems, the opposite is often true in grassland, shrubland and desert habitats. In these systems, fire incidence has been increasing, often due to the spread of non-native vegetation, with negative consequences for native plants and animals. Thus no single prescription for fire management will work in all areas. Programs of prescribed burning, highly successful in some forests, may not succeed in other habitats. \r\n<p>The challenge for managers seeking to restore more normal fire dynamics to a particular region is indeed, as Allen observes, to know something about fire: how fire has historically affected the local system, and how it functions today. Across the West, USGS researchers, in collaboration with scientists from numerous other agencies and institutions, are providing this information through detailed studies of fire history and fire ecology in different environments. USGS Director Charles G. \"Chip\" Groat says that, \"Knowledge from these studies is forming the basis for new policies aimed at restoring fire cycles that will present a lower risk to human life and property, and help safeguard the stability and diversity of western ecosystems.\" \r\n<p><b>Sierra Nevada Forests<\/b> \r\n<p>Since the 1960s, pioneering studies on the effects of both forest fires and decades of fire suppression have been carried out in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California in Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

Perhaps many sandpipers, plovers, knots, and others will end up feeding and roosting in agricultural fields in eastern Tennessee or Kentucky.\" Also of concern is the endangered Northeast breeding population of roseate terns. But Patuxent biologist Jeff Spendelow believes the terns may dodge the predicted path of the hurricane because it is rather late in the season, and most birds may be well on their way from their summer staging area in Cape Cod, Mass., to northern South America where they overwinter. He adds, however, \"We won&rsquo;t know for sure if Floyd will have affected these migrating terns until next summer when we census the major colonies on the East coast in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine.\" \r\n<p>Spendelow said that sometimes even several years of study and analysis are needed before scientists can accurately determine all the effects of hurricanes on birds. For example, Patuxent scientists and their cooperators have only just recently been able to determine the full effects on roseate terns of Hurricane Bob, which occurred in the fall of 1991. They learned that Hurricane Bob almost doubled the death rate of overwintering adult roseate terns, and that only about five percent of the young terns from that year survived and eventually entered the breeding population in later years. \r\n<p>Other studies at Patuxent include the effects of deer browsing on vegetation in the flood plain of the Patuxent River. Although the floodplain ecology involves periodic flooding, a serious flood from Hurricane Floyd could obscure the effects of deer browsing, according to biologist Richard Hammerschlag. \r\n<p>Erwin added that Patuxent biologists will go to the Virginia coastal marshes to evaluate the impacts of Hurricanes Floyd and Dennis on sediment deposition in their marsh study plots established this spring. \r\n<p>Also concerned with erosion are scientists from the National Wetlands Research Center, headquartered in Lafayette, La. According to Center Director Bob Stewart, the Center routinely studies hurricane effects and develops computer models to predict effects on wildlife habitat; uses remote sensing and geographic information systems to study and monitor wetland responses to hurricanes; and researches hurricane effects on coastal erosion and wetland forests. In the wake of Hurricane Floyd, Center scientists will be monitoring study sites in Florida and the Carolinas. \r\n<p>Stewart reported that hurricanes have the ability to massively change wildlife habitats of barrier islands, coastal marshes and forests. He said some of these habitats such as beaches and dunes initially change rapidly but in time sometimes return to their former structure. \"But sometimes changes from hurricanes result in permanent loss of upland and marsh habitat. Hurricanes are important elements that shape these truly dynamic coastal systems.\" \r\n<p>The Florida and Caribbean Science Center in Gainesville has ongoing fish research at the Timicuan Ecological and Historical Preserve and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida.

In addition, fires set by Native Americans and European settlers have influenced vegetation patterns in the Southeast for centuries. \n<p>The effects of fire are not subtle. Frequent fire can dramatically change the structure of a forest; for example, it can change a forest from one with thick underbrush to one with a parklike, cathedral structure. But while fire is essential to the maintenance of some ecosystems, it has long been viewed solely as a destructive force that needs to be controlled. Over the past several centuries, extensive fire suppression efforts have been one of the most pervasive human impacts on the natural ecosystems of this region, and, according to fire ecologists, altered fire regimes have contributed to the current threatened status of a number of native habitats in the southern United States. \r\n<p>The importance of fire in managing public lands in the Southeast has long been recognized. The largest controlled burn programs in the National Park System are carried out in this region of the United States in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Florida. Prescribed burning on public lands can help maintain the Southeast&rsquo;s unique species and ecosystems, and reduces the risk of catastrophic wildfires. \r\n<p>However much remains to be learned about the effects of fire -- both natural and manmade -- on southeastern woodlands, wetlands and coastal prairies. USGS scientists are studying the fire ecology of the Southeast from a variety of perspectives. Efforts are under way to understand the complex ecological effects of natural fires, such as the massive North Florida fires of 1998, and to determine how fire may best be applied as a management tool to maintain the diversity and vitality of systems in which the natural fire regime has been disrupted. \r\n<p><b>North Florida<\/b> \r\n<p>In the summer of 1998, recalls USGS ecologist Dr. Sue Grace, much of North and Central Florida was ablaze. The disastrous Florida fire season that year was largely the result of an unusual sequence of climatic conditions linked to El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o. The previous winter had been warm and exceptionally wet, stimulating plant growth and limiting the ability of managers to reduce fuel loads through controlled burning. \r\n<p>This pattern changed abruptly with the onset of a severe drought in the spring of 1998. Areas that were too wet for managed burns a few months before quickly became too dry. Lightning activity increased in early summer, but with little accompanying rainfall. In the end, says Grace, the fuel conditions and the weather conditions created a catastrophic event. Throughout June and July some 2,500 fires, many of severe intensity, burned roughly half a million acres of the Florida landscape. \r\n<p>In the fall of 1998, Grace, of the USGS National Wetlands Research Center, joined an interagency team of scientists formed under the leadership of the USGS and the U.S. Forest Service with support from the federal Joint Fire Science Board. The research team, which included representatives from a number of federal and state agencies as well as private institutions, had been mobilized to rapidly assess and study the ecological and economic impacts of the Florida wildfires. \r\n<p>Over the past year Grace&rsquo;s work has focused on how native and exotic plant species have responded in the aftermath of the severe wildfire. Of particular concern have been two categories of plants: endemic species, whose only existing populations occur in Florida, and exotic or non-native species, which often have the potential to invade new areas in the wake of a severe disturbance. \r\n<p>Grace says","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alabama","Florida","Georgia","Louisiana","Mississippi","Texas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"937540800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"168875"},{"tid":"169015"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Releases Assessment of Nation&rsquo;s Biological Resources","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->The common theme of a report detailing the first large-scale assessment of the health and status and trends of the nation&rsquo;s biological resources is that across the United States land use, water use and invasive species are the three factors most responsible for reported and often dramatic declines in the country&rsquo;s plants, animals and ecosystems<!--introend-->, said Dr. Charles G. \"Chip\" Groat, director of the U.S. Geological Survey, in a keynote speech today announcing the release of the government report. \n<p>The two-volume report, Status and Trends of the Nation&rsquo;s Biological Resources, was presented today at the S. Dillon Ripley Center in the Smithsonian Institution in an event sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Smithsonian Institute for Conservation Biology, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. \r\n<p>The report was produced by the U.S. Geological Survey with contributions from nearly 200 experts from federal government, academic and nongovernmental communities, including a section on marine resources written by the National Marine Fisheries Service. It synthesizes current information on status and trends of biological resources with a historical perspective of ecosystems across the country to assess how the nation&rsquo;s resources are changing. The report also covers the major factors that affect biological resources nationwide. \r\n<p>The report, said Groat, documents that the major land-use changes negatively affecting the health of biological resources are urbanization, conversion of lands to agriculture, draining of wetlands and the fragmentation of forests. \"For example,\" he said, \"in seven states once covered with native grasslands, less than 1 percent of the native tall-grass prairie habitat remains. Losses are due to agriculture, grazing, urbanization and mineral extraction. The result is that native grassland bird species have shown more consistent, widespread and steeper declines than any other group of North American birds.\" \r\n<p>Likewise, he said, the report details how changes in the nation&rsquo;s waterways to accommodate navigation, irrigation, hydroelectric power generation and municipal use have drastically altered the biological integrity of aquatic environments. The result, he said, is that aquatic organisms dominate lists of imperiled species. \r\n<p>Particularly dramatic examples of the imperilment of aquatic systems occur in the Southeast and the Southwest, Groat said. \"In the Southeast, where as many as 144 major reservoirs have been built, the effects of these dams on the wealth of aquatic biodiversity are dramatic &mdash; 19 percent of the freshwater fish species are threatened or endangered, and 73 percent of the freshwater mussels are at risk. And in the Southwest, habitat loss due to dams, groundwater pumping and pollution have contributed to jeopardizing more than 48 percent of the region&rsquo;s fish species.\" \r\n<p>Groat called invasions by non-native species one of the most important issues in natural resource management and conservation biology today. \"Invasive species are especially troublesome because many of them have become established in habitats that have no natural competitors or predators, enabling the invaders to thrive to the extent where they either out-compete native species, significantly alter habitat or both,\" he said. \r\n<p>In the Great Lakes, for example, the report shows that at least 25 non-native fish species, as well as many other invasive aquatic organisms, have become established, drastically changing the fishery, Groat said. \"Similarly, Eastern forests have ben defoliated by gypsy moths; elm and chestnut trees have been decimated by non-native diseases; and a non-native fungus called anthracnose threatens dogwood trees.\" \r\n<p>The report also notes that non-native species are particularly devastating on island communities, as is evident in Hawaii, where about 90 in","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"937540800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169015"},{"tid":"169015"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Responds to Hurricane Floyd in Virginia","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Heavy rains have occurred as Floyd moved into eastern and central Virginia.

Since May, dead toads have been found every month at the site, which is on private lands west of Denver. USGS researchers said they have identified chytrid fungus in many of the dead and living toads they examined from the site in 1999. Live toads show few clinical signs of the disease, but some may appear weak, lethargic and reluctant to flee at the approach of humans. \r\n<p>Dr. D. Earl Green, a USGS wildlife pathologist, microscopically examined many of the dead toads and identified myriads of minute chytrid fungi in the skin of the abdomen and toes of the toads. His microscopic identification of this fungus is being confirmed in collaborative work by Dr. Joyce Longcore, a world-renowned chytrid expert at the University of Maine. In addition, USGS researchers will continue to work closely with researchers from the Colorado Division of Wildlife to monitor further die-offs. \r\n<p>Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt calls these recent die-offs of boreal toads a \"poignant reminder\" that amphibian populations in this country and in many other parts of the world are undergoing severe, unexplained declines. In the past decade, the international scientific community has increasingly expressed concern over global population declines in all amphibian groups and on many continents. These losses are now well documented and have occurred in a wide range of habitats, including remote and pristine areas in Oregon, California, Arizona, the Rocky Mountain states, Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico and Australia. \r\n<p>\"These incidences are disturbing and raise questions about why this fungus is proving so deadly at this time and what other factors might be at work behind the scenes,\" Secretary Babbitt said. \"We need to better understand the inter-relationships in this environmental puzzle and what we can do to fix the situation.\" \r\n<p>Chytrid fungus in amphibians was first identified in 1998 by Green and other researchers from the U.S., Great Britain and Australia, who discovered that this fungus had been responsible for large amphibian die-offs in Panama and Australia. The fungus also has been identified in some amphibian populations in Arizona and has caused the death of many zoo-kept amphibians in the United States. \r\n<p>Scientists don&rsquo;t know how this fungus is transmitted from one area to another, let alone why the fungus is affecting amphibian populations around the world. Whether the chytrid fungus is responsible for the frog or toad mortality or the declines of frogs and toads in many western states is still unknown. Green emphasizes that diagnostic tests on the boreal toads are still being completed, and that additional infectious diseases or other possible causes of death may yet be found in this population. Because fungal infections are often considered secondary infections in other vertebrates, USGS is completing further tests for viruses, parasites and bacteria to rule out other factors that could predispose the animals&rsquo; susceptibility to the fungus. \r\n<p>Two other Colorado populations of boreal toads in Rocky Mountain National Park have also undergone serious declines this summer and previously in 1996, according to zoologists at the USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Fort Collins, Co., who have been studying these populations for the past 9 years.

Day, the first dentist in Indian Territory. He grew up in Tulsa Oklahoma. In 1951, he received his B.S. degree in geology from Yale University where he was a varsity football player. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, he completed his M.S. degree in geology from Colorado University in 1957. In 1957, he joined Stanolind, later Pan American Petroleum Corporation and then Amoco, working principally on the stratigraphy of petroleum-bearing rocks in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas. In 1962, he returned to Yale University to pursue a doctorate in geology, and he was awarded that degree in 1965. He returned to Pan American until 1970, when he was appointed Chairman of the Division of Science and Mathematics at West Georgia College in Carrollton, Georgia. In 1973, he joined the USGS as Chief of the Office of Energy Resources and Marine Geology. In 1980, he resumed research with the USGS, and until his retirement in 1995, he served as Chief of the World Energy Resources Project for that agency. \r\n<p>During his tenure as the Chief of the Office of Energy Resources, he directed the first comprehensive national assessment of the undiscovered oil and gas resources of the United States. That assessment, published in 1975, provided a significant frame of reference for the formulation of energy policy initiatives by the United States Government. \r\n<p>As Chief of the World Energy Resources Project, Masters assembled a group of experts who focused on the world-wide occurrence and assessment of oil and gas resources. This group prepared a series of world assessments of undiscovered oil and gas that were presented to and published by the World Petroleum Congresses in 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1994. The global oil and gas resource assessments developed under his leadership were unique in their scientific breadth, statistical rigor, and economic value. These scientific assessments and their updated versions continue to be used by a wide range of government organizations, policymakers, and industry planners worldwide. \r\n<p>\"Chuck had the foresight to see that a comprehensive global assessment of oil and gas should be one of our major scientific goals,\" said USGS Director Charles G. Groat. \"He then pursued that goal with tenacity, good judgment, and a clear vision of what the product should be. Our country and our science are enormously indebted to him for his exceptional contributions. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him and appreciated his many talents,\" said Groat. \r\n<p>Masters was a member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, of Sigma Xi, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Fellow of the Geological Society of America. He received the Meritorious Service Award of the Department of the Interior in 1981. \r\n<p>He had a great love of sports and the outdoors which continued throughout his life. In addition to preserving the natural beauty of his property in East Hampton, he and his family enjoyed the National Parks of this country, and he was able to travel with his wife throughout the world.

Groat. \r\n<p>When responding to a major coastal storm, one of the first USGS priorities is to provide maps of the affected areas to local, state, and federal emergency management agencies. Map requests come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The large format of the 1:100,000-scale maps helps responders plot the boundaries of a disaster area and determine the number of households involved, thus providing vital information on food, clothing, and shelter requirements. \r\n<p>Meanwhile, other USGS scientists will track flooding, monitor coastal erosion, and survey the effects of the storm on plants and animals. \r\n<p>USGS flood crews will be at work on rivers to measure the height and volume of flood waters. The USGS national network of real-time streamflow gaging stations provides this critical data on river stages and discharges to the National Weather Service for forecasting floods. USGS water data are available on the World Wide Web at <a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov <\/a>; scroll down the web page and click on Real-Time Water Data, then click on the state in which you are interested. In addition, USGS hydrologic technicians often assist other Federal agencies in the collection of data on storm surges (abnormally high tides caused by storm winds) after the hurricane. \r\n<p>One possible, long-term effect of hurricanes is vastly accelerated coastal erosion, which USGS geologists have been studying for a number of years. Coastal change studies performed by USGS scientists provide crucial information not only for coastal planners and managers, but property owners as well. \r\n<p>\"When we know the coastal profile, the shoreline cities can establish a reasonable construction set-back to prevent unnecessary property losses,\" said Bruce Richmond, a USGS geologist in Menlo Park, Calif., who specializes in storm effects. \"We can&rsquo;t prevent hurricanes, but geologic mapping in areas where storms are frequent can help minimize losses by identifying the locations that are most likely to suffer.\" \r\n<p>Damage from a major coastal storm can reach far beyond the area of the actual landfall. USGS biologists are also involved in making assessments of the damage caused to plants, animals and ecosystems by the hurricane wherever it strikes. Natural systems in the Caribbean region and the southeastern part of the United States have been weathering hurricanes for thousands of years, with plants and animals forced to adapt","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"935640000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170024"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS &#39;PUT ME ON HOLD&#39;SO POPULAR THAT NEW NUMBER IS INSTALLED &mdash; OR BUY IT ON A CD","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Also available on the Internet at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html <\/a>\n<p>\r\n<p><!--introstart-->The U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., has had to install an extra telephone line, to accommodate callers who just want to be put on hold for a few minutes. <!--introend-->The callers have become hooked on listening to a series of questions and answers about earth-science trivia that they hear when it&rsquo;s necessary to wait for their call to go through.

In the wake of the Bolinas earthquake, the intensity map based on human responses closely resembles the intensity map based on seismic instruments. \r\n<p>Although the site was developed and is maintained at the USGS in Pasadena, Calif., the site isn&rsquo;t limited to California earthquakes.

This has become a problem for Lakes Wingra and Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin. Phosphorus can originate from urban sources such as animal waste, lawn fertilizer, soil particles, leaves, and grass clippings which get washed to the lakes during rain events. \r\n<p>Samplers were used to collect phosphorus data from five source areas&mdash;streets, lawns, roofs, driveways, and parking lots. The data was input into a computer model to determine which source areas are contributing the most phosphorus within the basins. The stormwater-runoff samples from source areas and the basin outfall were collected from three basins. The three basins were (1)the Monroe Basin&mdash;a residential basin on the west side of Madison that drains to Lake Wingra, (2) the Harper Basin&mdash;a residential basin on the east side of Madison that drains to Lake Mendota, and (3) the Lakeland Basin&mdash; an older residential basin on Madison&rsquo;s Isthmus that drains to Lake Monona. The Lakeland Basin was monitored for lawn runoff only. The data bases, created for this study, are the largest to date using the most advanced source-area sample collection technology available. \r\n<p>The City of Madison and Dane County can now use the data to devise management strategies to reduce the amounts of phosphorus discharged to the lakes. Lakes Mendota and Wingra are both part of the WDNR Priority Watershed Program. The Lake Mendota Priority Watershed Project&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the frequency of algae blooms in the lakes from one out of every two days to one out of every five days. To accomplish this goal, it is estimated that a 50-percent reduction is needed in the amount of phosphorus entering the lake. To reach this target, the Nonpoint Source Control Plan for the Lake Mendota Priority Watershed Project set a goal of reducing phosphorus loading to the lake by 20 percent from urban areas. The remaining 30-percent reduction is intended to come from rural phosphorus management. \r\n<p>The report, titled &quot;Sources of Phosphorus in Stormwater and Street Dirt from Two Urban Residential Basins in Madison, Wisconsin, 1994&ndash;95,&quot; R.J.

And that salt water is bringing with it a variety of new concerns for local resource managers. \n<p>USGS scientists who have been tracking this \"saltwater encroachment\" phenomenon are finding the increases in salinity are creating a host of unusual environmental issues. The data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey is being used by local decision-makers to inform and protect citizens. \r\n<p>\"We&rsquo;ve spotted crabs in the St. Jones River near our monitoring station in downtown Dover, Delaware,\" said USGS hydrologist Dan Soeder. \"Crabs only like salt water, so you know that has to be salty water.\" \r\n<p>On another tidal stream in central Delaware, one farmer couldn&rsquo;t understand why corn, irrigated with what is usually fresh water from that stream, was wilting. Soeder said the USGS found salt content has been as high as 5,000 parts per million - one half that of ocean water. \r\n<p>\"He had to stop using that water on his fields,\" Soeder said. \"You don&rsquo;t want to salt your corn before you cook it.\" \r\n<p>Meanwhile, on the Hudson River, USGS scientists there have been tracking a different kind of salt problem - a slowly creeping salt front which is threatening water supplies in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., a city of about 30,000 located 75 miles north of New York City. \r\n<p>\"The salt front is about five miles downstream of the water intakes for the Poughkeepsie water supply,\" said USGS hydrologist Ward Freeman. \"Right now, it&rsquo;s standing still and water which is being pumped into the Hudson from area reservoirs is keeping the salt front at bay.\" \r\n<p>But, Freeman said, the salt front may begin moving upstream again and only significant rainfall will wash out the threat. \"It&rsquo;s serious because Poughkeepsie relies on freshwater from the Hudson. They don&rsquo;t have any groundwater resources they can draw from,\" he said. \r\n<p>Poughkeepsie faced a similar problem during the drought of 1995 when the salt front threatened the area&rsquo;s water supply system. Then, the USGS worked with the New York State Department of Health to coordinate releases from the Sacandaga Reservoir preventing further saltwater movement while minimizing effects on the reservoir. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The Delaware River, which feeds much of the Philadelphia region&rsquo;s water supply, is also being monitored closely for saltwater encroachment. Teams of USGS scientists monitor river water constantly at a gaging station and crews from the city of Philadelphia gather their own data at least once a day. Currently, the salt front is near the Philadelphia International Airport; 20 miles downstream from the city&rsquo;s water intakes. But the salt front is 11 to 12 miles upriver of where it normally is in summer. The current salt front is only about 12 miles from its record location during the drought of 1966 when it was just north of the Ben Franklin Bridge. \r\n<p>\"We have to keep the salt front downstream from the mouth of the Schuykill River,\" said USGS Hydrologist Tony Navoy in New Jersey. \"There are a series of reservoirs up the Delaware River and into New York and we have to tap into those to keep the river flows high enough to keep the salt at bay.\" \r\n<p>Navoy said a well field near Pennsauken, N.J., which serves much of suburban Trenton could be affected if the salt front moves further upriver. If groundwater levels in that well field fall below mean sea level and if river water is salty, that salt can intrude into the aquifer and contaminate it. Even if the river is salty only temporarily, it could take one to two years for the salt to show up in public water supplies drawn from the aquifer. But salt is persistent.

Scott, retired USGS geologist, features a smorgasbord of historical information, including the locations of Indian, early immigrant and cattle trails, as well as stage routes, stage stops, toll roads, toll gates, existing and abandoned railroads, ghost towns, military camps, mountain passes, ranches, quarries, mines, archeological sites, and vertebrate fossil sites. The area of the quadrangle includes the Denver metro area and extends to include Brighton on the north, the Great Plains on the east, the Air Force Academy on the south, and Fairplay on the west. \r\n<p>A 53-page text pamphlet complements the two-sheet map, and describes all of the proposed and established toll roads and the established railroads in the Denver quadrangle. The pamphlet also contains a list of nearly all the camps, forts, posts, and military bases in Colorado, not just those in the Denver quadrangle. \r\n<p>In modern automobiles traveling over smooth paved roads it takes a little more than an hour to drive from Denver to Colorado Springs on Interstate 25. Imagine that same trip in the 1860&rsquo;s. Small towns were generally spaced no more than 10 miles apart, the maximum distance a team and wagon could travel to town and back in a day on the dusty and rutted wagon trails. A trip by wagon from Denver to Colorado Springs during this time period might take three or four days to complete. \r\n<p>\"This map is the first in the trail-map series to display photographs and sketches that relate to the historical events and places depicted on the map,\" said Scott, who spent 4-years working on the product. Special attention is given to historic trails and wagon roads, Indian tribes, cattle trails, railroads, and the gold rush. Each topic is briefly discussed, and numerous photographs dating back as far as the 1860&rsquo;s are shown on the map sheets. \r\n<p>The publication is available through the USGS Earth Science Information Center (ESIC) as map I-2639 by contacting 303\/203-4700 or 1-888-ASK-USGS.

There is no charge for the report, but there may be a postage charge for multiple copies. \n<p>Written originally as a report to the USGS director, Circular 1184 is a summary of and commentary on the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s \"Viability Assessment of a Repository at Yucca Mountain,\" a five-volume synthesis of 15 years of study of the Yucca Mountain site as a potential underground repository for the nation&rsquo;s spent nuclear-reactor fuel. The USGS publication also includes striking images of Yucca Mountain in its local and regional settings, and illustrations of the geologic and engineering features of the proposed repository system. \r\n<p>In the publication&rsquo;s foreward, USGS Director Charles Groat writes, \"All citizens of our country should know about radioactive-waste-disposal issues in general and Yucca Mountain in particular.

The proposed engineering of the repository system must act in concert with the geologic assets of the repository system, rather than interfere with them.\" Circular 1184 addresses this interplay between engineering and the earth sciences, in several respects.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"934344000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"CALL THE USGS, GET PUT ON HOLD, AND LOVE IT&mdash;PUBLIC ASKS FOR MORE","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Also available on the Internet at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html <\/a>\n<p><!--introstart-->A frequent complaint of persons conducting business by telephone is the amount of time they spend waiting on hold, forced to listen to silence or music that someone else thinks they might enjoy. <!--introend-->Even when the music is classically uplifting, as with United Airlines theme, there is a limit to how many times one wishes to hear the same song. \r\n<p>Such, apparently is not the case with callers to the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. For the past few months callers to the agency&rsquo;s regional offices have had the opportunity to learn something while they are holding. Some like it so well that they are calling USGS offices and saying, \"I really don&rsquo;t want to talk to anyone, but could you just put me on hold for a few minutes?\" \r\n<p>The object of their new-found audio delight is neither a dramatic or soothing piece of music, but a series of questions and answers about planet Earth, and its neighbors. Ranging from earthquakes to water usage and the temperature of the surface of Venus, the 196 responses give the caller a montage of interesting scientific fact and figures. \r\n<p>The idea for the new \"hold and learn\" service is the brainchild of Carol Lawson in the Survey&rsquo;s Western Region Branch of Information Services. In addition to telecommunication responsibilities, the branch is also responsible for the USGS Menlo Park switchboard which directs customer calls to the appropriate USGS resource. \"I chose not to use music to entertain callers placed on hold because of diversity of tastes in music. However, it seemed perfectly logical that if a person was calling an earth sciences agency, they might like to learn more about earth and planetary sciences while they were waiting for their call to be answered,\" Lawson said. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Rather than writing a proposal and forming a committee to study the possibility of such a project, Lawson, who holds bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in science disciplines, obtained the required approval to produce an audio CD, and just did it. She was fortunate to have the enthusiastic assistance of Mary Ellen Lazarus who played a key role in obtaining information from many USGS scientists. Lawson then added these contributions to her own material, and on weekends and during long business flights, she began formatting them into a question and answer format. In late 1998 Lawson completed the questions and answers, and Lazarus worked with various USGS scientists to verify their accuracy and complete the editorial review required to publish them as a USGS Open File Report. When the editorial review was completed, the next step was to record the material for production of the CD. Co-workers began suggesting their favorite celebrity to be \"the voice of the USGS,\" but Lawson knew that getting a professional would mean contract negotiations and lots of money, and this was a low budget project. So she asked three fellow employees and a USGS Volunteer for Science who have nice, believable voices to record the CD. They agreed and recording time was booked at a local studio. Within weeks the CD was being played on the USGS telephone system \"on-hold subsystem,\" and callers began hearing the science questions and answers. The CD plays continuously, but the caller rarely hears the same material twice. An example of the material a caller might hear is \"Where and when did the largest earthquake occur in the twentieth century?\" Answer: \"The 1960 Chilean earthquake, which occurred off the coast of South America. It had a magnitude of 9.6 and broke a fault over 1,000 miles long.\" The questions and answers are generally grouped according to subject matter or science discipline. \r\n<p>After learning that they had stumbled onto something that contained a wealth of","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"934171200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"What on Earth Is Going on . . . on Earth?","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Have you ever wondered who studies the Earth&rsquo;s lands and waters?

For example, the agency is bringing together its science capabilities in South Florida where USGS geologists, hydrologists, biologists and mappers are working to understand how to help that fragile and greatly altered ecosystem - one of America&rsquo;s natural treasures - survive into the future. \r\n<p>Hydrologists with the USGS have helped to protect the purity and drinkability of America&rsquo;s waters by making resource managers and policymakers aware of contaminants such as MTBE in the nation&rsquo;s water supplies. \r\n<p>Besides helping to understand America&rsquo;s lands and waters, the USGS also works to understand the earth&rsquo;s wildlife and vegetation populations. For example, over the past 10 years, the USGS has successfully established a new nesting site at Padre Island National Seashore for the world&rsquo;s most endangered sea turtle. \r\n<p>By providing food and recreational opportunities to people and by indicating the health of aquatic environments, America&rsquo;s fish populations are of crucial importance to our future. The lake trout, restored in Lake Superior through the efforts of USGS scientists working with natural resource management agencies, is highly prized by recreational anglers and by professional chefs. Millions of hatchery-raised salmon and trout have been saved from possible destruction because DNA probes developed by USGS biologists can now be used to distinguish between the virulent European and more benign North American strains of a highly feared fish disease agent. \r\n<p>The publication can be read on the World Wide Web by going to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nwrc.usgs.gov\/world\/\">http:\/\/www.nwrc.usgs.gov\/world\/<\/a>.

Hirsch. \"With the recent lack of precipitation throughout the East, conditions do not look positive for any improvement in the immediate future. \r\n<p>\"Farmers, rural homeowners with private wells and small communities are feeling the drought most severely. Major metropolitan areas, because of good planning in the wake of earlier droughts, generally have sufficient storage,\" Hirsch said. \"Water supply is like a bank account.

Water not used today is generally water in the bank for tomorrow.\" \r\n<p>The U.S. Geological Survey said today that in New England, 70 percent of streams have recorded below-normal flows and record lows have been set in 13 percent of those streams. In southern Maine, for example, record-low streamflows were recorded this week on the Piscatiquis, Carrabassett, Sandy, Swift, Sheepscot, Narraguagus, and Royal Rivers. \r\n<p>In the Southeast, nearly 75 percent of streamflows are below normal this week. Just a week ago, only 52 percent of streamflows were below normal. Record-low flows have now been set on 10 percent of those stations, where a week ago, only 1 percent were breaking records. USGS stream gages in North Carolina reported record lows for Friday on the Ararat, South Yadkin, Broad and Star rivers. \r\n<p>Hirsch said that Indiana and Ohio have begun to feel the effects of the drought as well. In Ohio, high temperatures combined with lower-than-normal precipitation are causing crops to wither and streamflows to dry up. In Indiana, low stream flows have been reported in the Silver Creek and the East Fork of the White River where streamflows are 55 percent below normal. The Mississinewa River, in Randolph County, in eastern Indiana, was nearly dry on Friday morning. \r\n<p>In the Mid-Atlantic, West Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and parts of Virginia have declared local drought warnings or emergencies and some areas now have mandatory water-use restrictions in place.

Even the streams least affected by the drought conditions, the St. Jones and the Nanticoke, flowed at only 41% of their long-term July averages. \r\n<p><b>\"Since there was very little rain in July, virtually all the flow in the Delmarva&rsquo;s rivers and streams is now coming from ground water seeping into streams,\" said Dan Soeder, Delaware subdistrict chief for the USGS. \r\n<p><\/b>\r\n<p><b>At the same time, \"ground-water levels were significantly below average in July, have been falling since April and May, and are continuing to fall in all seven water-table observation wells monitored by the Delaware Geological Survey (DGS) in the Atlantic Coastal Plain,\" said John Talley, Associate Director of the DGS.<\/b> These observation wells measure water levels in the surficial (unconfined) aquifer. Water levels in the observation well in northern New Castle County have been below average since November 1998. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The lowest ground-water level on record in the observation well near Jefferson&rsquo;s Crossroads in Sussex County was recorded in July. The second lowest ground-water level on record in the well in southern New Castle County near Blackbird State Forest was recorded in July. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Most private wells on the Delmarva Peninsula get their water from the surficial aquifer. The surficial aquifer is also used by farmers for irrigation water. Municipal water supplies for cities like Dover, Milford, and Lewes are obtained from deep, confined aquifers that are less affected by the drought. \r\n<p><b>Current and potential impacts of these drought conditions include:<\/b> \r\n<p><b>o Higher salinity levels further upstream in Chesapeake and Delaware Bay waters and in coastal low-gradient streams<\/b> will affect public water supplies and have general ecological impacts in the streams and adjacent wetlands. Upstream salinity has already caused problems at surface-water intakes in New Castle County. Higher than usual salinity levels in Chesapeake Bay waters could encourage the growth of oyster diseases. Jellyfish are in abundant supply already this summer. \r\n<p><b>o Slow recovery of water supplies, especially ground water.<\/b> The months of rainfall well below average have depleted the water system in the region, so that it will take months of average or even above average rainfall to replenish the groundwater system and large reservoirs and lakes. Single large rainstorms may help, but will not fix, the problem. \r\n<p><b>o Increased stress on fish in streams.<\/b> The local movement of fish will be impeded in small streams as riffles become too shallow for them to cross or if the level of dissolved oxygen in the water drops due to localized algal blooms or other phenomena.

The USGS reported these findings in a congressional briefing held today (August 2). \r\n<p>\"Freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake Bay was at record lows in June and July, with corresponding lows in its major contributing tributaries,\" Hirsch said. \"This is leading to the increased salinity, low dissolved oxygen causing massive fish kills, and other effects on the ecology of the Bay.

Communities and families that depend on wells are already experiencing water shortages in many parts of the MidAtlantic region. \r\n<p>\"For more than 100 years, the U.S. Geological Survey has operated networks of streamflow gages and ground-water wells that form the backbone of the nation&rsquo;s drought monitoring capability.

Roffe received the Department of the Interior&rsquo;s Superior Service Award for his outstanding contributions to wildlife health and natural resources management in the Greater Yellowstone Area during a recent meeting of the Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee. <!--introend-->\n<p>According to the citation, Roffe&rsquo;s leadership of the Department of Interior&rsquo;s brucellosis research program since 1995 resulted in a long-needed dedicated program focused on resolving the issue of brucellosis in Greater Yellowstone Area wildlife. \r\n<p>About 3,500 bison and 120,000 elk in 27 separate herd units in the Greater Yellowstone Area are affected by brucellosis, a disease that causes cattle and wildlife to abort their first calves following infection. The issue has national and international significance because of major, expensive brucellosis eradication programs in the United States and many other countries. After millions of dollars of research since 1934, the United States is now on the verge of completing brucellosis eradication in cattle. \r\n<p>Soon, said Roffe, elk and bison of the Greater Yellowstone Area will be the only reservoir for potential re-infection of livestock in the United States. Consequently, said Roffe, states and countries that have successfully eradicated the disease may require extensive testing or forbid import of cattle from Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, which surround the Greater Yellowstone Area. Controlling and eliminating a disease in free-ranging wildlife distributed over the immense area of the Greater Yellowstone Area will not be easy, said Roffe, who is exploring the potential for eradicating brucellosis in elk and bison through a brucellosis vaccine. \r\n<p>\"Vaccination of wild bison and elk is one of the few acceptable methods to combat brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Area,\" said Dr. Chip Groat, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. \"Tom Roffe designed, and helped implement some of the first statistically valid experiments to determine both the effectiveness and safety of cattle brucellosis vaccines in elk and bison,\" said Groat. \r\n<p>Groat said that \"solid and sound\" information resulting in more accurate wildlife disease transmission models is the result of Roffe&rsquo;s other research, done in collaboration with other agencies, on how brucellosis originates and develops, as well as on the epidemiology of the disease _ that is, the incidence, distribution and factors related to disease in a population. Before Roffe&rsquo;s research, scientists had to use more unreliable cattle data to \"model\" how the disease might work in free-ranging bison. Now, researchers can use much more reliable species-specific data to model the effects of various management actions on brucellosis in wildlife, said Groat. \r\n<p>\"The results of Roffe&rsquo;s pioneering research on free-ranging bison have led to productive, collaborative approaches to information gathering, analysis and management planning throughout the Greater Yellowstone Area,\" Groat said in citing Roffe for the award. \r\n<p>Dr. Roffe also serves as an adjunct faculty in the Department of Biology at Montana State University. His numerous research projects include collaborators from a wide variety of state and federal agencies and universities, including USDA\/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA\/Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Idaho Fish and Game, Montana Department of Livestock, Texas A&amp;M University and Montana State University. \r\n<p>Roffe received his undergraduate degree in biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz; a Ph.D. in biological oceanography from Oregon State University, and his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Oregon State and Washington State Universities.

On the bottom of western Lake Erie, larval mayflies -- known as nymphs -- once numbered in the hundreds per square meter. But populations decreased dramatically in the 1950s due to deteriorating water quality, and throughout most of the next three decades burrowing mayflies were virtually absent from their former Great Lakes habitat. \r\n<p>For the last five years, however, a remarkable recovery has been under way. Edsall and his colleagues at the USGS Great Lakes Science Center report that nymphs in western Lake Erie have increased from near zero to numbers approaching those of the early twentieth century. \r\n<p>Edsall says the mayfly recovery is a strong sign that improvements in water quality, which have been taking place since the 1970s, have resulted in a healthier, more normally functioning ecosystem. \"This is a real tribute to the EPA&rsquo;s enforcement of water pollution control laws, such as the Clean Water Act and U.S. and Canadian cooperation through the Great Lakes Quality Agreement,\" he says. \r\n<p>USGS and Canadian biologists have used several different methods to determine the past distribution and abundance of burrowing mayflies in Lake Erie and to understand how the insects have responded to different forms of water and sediment of contamination. Sediment core samples, dating back to about 1740, contain jaw parts and other preserved remains that provide a continuous record of burrowing mayfly densities in different regions of the lake. Other information comes from periodic sampling of nymph populations, which began in 1930, and from records of the incidence of mayflies in fish stomachs. \r\n<p>In the western-most end of the lake, USGS biologists Bruce Manny and Donald Schloesser have found that contamination of bottom sediments by oil and metals was the main factor in eliminating burrowing mayfly populations. New clean water standards have greatly reduced the amount of such contaminants released into the lake. Meanwhile the steady, natural accumulation of lake sediments has finally buried the toxins lining the lake bottom a few decades ago, creating a habitat that is again suitable burrowing mayflies. \r\n<p>Edsall says the massive declines of the 1950s were brought about by a combination of factors. Deep-water areas in central Lake Erie became periodically depleted of oxygen due to the decomposition of algae that had accumulated as a result of sewage and fertilizers entering the lake. This oxygen-deprived water sometimes moved into adjacent shallow areas occupied by nymphs, causing mass die-offs. \r\n<p>The recovery of this one species may be good news for the entire Lake Erie ecosystem, says Edsall. Burrowing mayflies play an important role in maintaining the transfer of energy and nutrients across different levels of aquatic food webs, and their burrowing activity re-suspends buried nutrients into the water, which fuels the growth of aquatic plants.

The Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation is an initiative of The Pew Charitable Trusts, based in Philadelphia, Pa., and operated in partnership with the New England Aquarium in Boston. \r\n<p>Estes&rsquo; interest in predators&rsquo; roles in ecosystems began with sea otters in western Alaska in the 1970&rsquo;s. He was a co-discoverer of the sea otter&rsquo;s keystone role in kelp forests. The sea otter, said Estes, is the top predator in a coastal food web composed of sea otter, sea urchin and kelp. The sea otter feeds on sea urchins and suppresses their numbers, which in turn enhances the total production of the coastal ecosystem. \r\n<p>Estes expects his proposed study to provide those charged with managing fisheries and marine mammals further information on how the Bering Sea and North Pacific ecosystem works and insight into why it is undergoing drastic change. \r\n<p>Habitat destruction is seen as a fundamental problem by conservation biologists studying ecosystems on land, said Estes. While large-scale habitat alteration is clearly evident on land, it is less evident in the oceans. \"Marine systems have collapsed in areas where there is simply no evidence of habitat destruction, such as in remote coastal regions and the open sea,\" said Estes. He suspects that the distances over which human effects are manifested are much greater at sea than they are on land. \r\n<p>Nominations for Pew Fellowships are made through an international network of environmental experts. Review and selection is conducted by a 12-member international advisory committee. Selection is based on the applied conservation merit of the proposal, the individual&rsquo;s professional achievement, and the potential impact of the project.

This year&rsquo;s successful nesting makes biologists optimistic that a recovery program for the puaiohi will ultimately succeed. \r\n<p>\"We are all excited that at least seven of the birds have nested this year,\" said USGS field biologist Erik Tweed of the USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center. \"The release effort at this time looks promising, in terms of re-establishing a self-sustaining population of puaiohi in their former range.\" \r\n<p>Tweed says that released birds have built 14 nests to date in the Alakai Wilderness Preserve on the island of Kauai. Some nests remain active or have already produced fledglings&ndash;chicks capable of leaving the nest. \r\n<p>Apart from the released birds, only 200-300 individuals of this small unique Hawaiian bird species survive in the wild. Biologists fear that at such low numbers, the population cannot sustain itself. In addition to the remnant wild population, a captive flock of 16 puaiohi is maintained at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center near Volcanoes National Park by The Peregrine Fund, a private conservation organization. \r\n<p>The Peregrine Fund reared 23 puaiohi in 1998, and in January and February of this year brought 14 of the young birds to Kauai. The birds were held in a hacking tower &mdash; a release cage &mdash; for one week and then released into their new home in the rain forest. The Alakai site was chosen because it offered suitable habitat and already supported a small puaiohi population. One benefit has been that some of the captive- bred birds are interbreeding with wild birds as well as each other. \r\n<p>USGS researchers who have been monitoring the birds say the released puaioho are showing some surprising characteristics. \"The exciting news has been the propensity of these birds to re-nest time after time, regardless of whether their nests have been successful or not, \" says USGS field biologist Jeffrey Foster. \r\n<p>While many songbirds initiate more than one nest during a single breeding season, Foster says some puaiohi are taking this to an unusual extreme. \"At least one of the females was building her new nest even before the young had fledged out of her first nest,\" he said. In another case, a single male is paired with two different females and is assisting both with nest duties &mdash; a breeding arrangement not previously known for this species. \r\n<p>In addition to monitoring the released birds, the USGS biologists are conducting ecological research on the wild puaiohi population and are removing non-native predators that prey upon the birds and their eggs. Unfortunately, said researchers, two nestling were taken by rats. \r\n<p>The puaiohi project is a cooperative effort involving the USGS, The Peregrine Fund, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. In addition, the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife administers and manages the habitat in which the recovery project is being conducted. \r\n<p>This research and conservation partnership began in Hawaii in 1993, as part of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098alala recovery program. The Peregrine, working in close collaboration with partner agencies, has hatched and reared 12 different species of native Hawaiian forest birds from three different islands.

The Charles River at Dover station, installed in 1937, had a previous minimum average flow for June of 67.2 cubic feet per second (cfs) recorded in 1957, whereas this June&rsquo;s average flow was 57.6 cfs&mdash;14 percent lower. At the Ipswich River at South Middleton station, established in 1938, the previous low for June was 7.36 cfs in 1966. This year&rsquo;s low for June was 6.55 cfs&mdash;11 percent lower. And at the Assabet River at Maynard station, in operation since 1941, the previous low for June was 39 cfs in 1949; this year the low flow for June averaged only 28.18 cfs&mdash;26 percent lower. \r\n<p>Record low water levels also have been measured in ground-water wells. The USGS maintains 139 observation wells in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and all but two of these had lower water levels in June than in May. For 132 wells with a minimum of five years of monthly record, one well in Franklin County had the lowest level since recording began there in 1986. Nineteen other wells showed new low levels for the month of June. \r\n<p>June is normally a wetter month than July and August; however, even with normal summer rainfall, groundwater aquifers generally do not receive significant recharge during this season. Thirsty plant roots intercept most of the moisture soaking into the ground before it reaches the water table. Then the plants &quot;transpire&quot; the moisture, along with oxygen, in a process known as evapotranspiration. In southern New England ground-water aquifers normally recharge during October through April, when most plants are dormant. \r\n<p>The USGS measures streamflows and water levels in 100 streams and 139 ground-water observation wells around the region. Water quality is also monitored at many sites. Records are available for some streamgaging stations dating back 85 years. Using these data, the USGS provides water-resources managers and the public with current, as well as historical, streamflow and ground-water level information. With these long-term records, it is possible to monitor trends of water quality and water quantity over time, and gage the severity of drought and flood conditions. \r\n<p>Real-time streamflow data, current water conditions, and descriptions of USGS water-resources investigations are available at the USGS Massachusetts - Rhode Island website at <a href=\"http:\/\/ma.water.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/ma.water.usgs.gov<\/a>.

This impact left behind a crater that is now buried under 400 to 1,200 feet of sand, silt, and clay.\" \r\n<p>Scientists with the USGS and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality have recently discovered the Chesapeake Bay impact crater. The USGS, in cooperation with the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, has just released the first of a series of planned reports describing the effects of the impact crater on the geology and hydrogeology in the region. \r\n<p>\"Ongoing analysis of this impact crater will yield a wealth of information,\" Powars said. \"It&rsquo;s the largest crater discovered so far in the United States, and it&rsquo;s one of only a few oceanic impact craters that have been documented worldwide. The Chesapeake Bay impact crater is shallower and more accessible than the much larger and older one off the coast of Mexico that most scientists believe led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.\" \r\n<p>The discovery of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater helps explain a number of unusual features that have been noted in the region, including salty ground water, earthquakes around the crater&rsquo;s perimeter, and an unusual rate of sea-level rise. \r\n<p>\"The object from outer space that hit the Earth millions of years ago appears to be responsible for the salty ground water that we find at depth over a large area in the bay region,\" Powars explained. \r\n<p>Virginia&rsquo;s \"inland saltwater wedge\" is a well-known but previously unexplained phenomenon. The impact of the comet or meteorite deformed and broke up the \"layer cake\" stack of aquifers (water-bearing rocks) and confining units, which restrict the flow of ground water. The outer rim of the crater seems to coincide with the boundary separating salty and fresh ground water. Salty ground water is found inside the crater. Fresh ground water is found outside of the crater. The report documents the location of the outer rim, which can be used to determine where fresh ground water is likely to be found. \r\n<p>The report presents a reinterpretation of the lower York-James Peninsula geologic framework and is the first step in understanding the ground-water flow system. \r\n<p>\"In other words,\" said Powars, \"first you have to describe the container and the material holding the water before you can begin to describe how the water flows.

Freshwater inflow to the Bay was less than 74% of the previously recorded low set in 1964, because flows from the Potomac, Susquehanna, and James Rivers all set new low flow records. \r\n<p>June 28 was the lowest flow day recorded for the month. During that day, almost half of the total Potomac River flow was used for water supply. (Total flow is computed using data from the USGS gage at Little Falls and municipal withdrawal figures.) Average daily flow in the Potomac in June 1999 was only about 24% of the flow in June 1998, and withdrawals for water supply were 25% higher than withdrawals in 1998. Consequently, unusually high proportions of river flow (33%) were diverted out of the river into public water supplies last month.

(More detailed explanation of this is provided as a link from the word \"percentile\" on the web site.) \r\n<p>In addition to the national map, tables of regional streamflow data are also available at the same site by clicking on the desired region. \r\n<p>Another feature of the site is a 5-day animation of streamflow conditions that will show, in a quick day-to-day snapshot, what has been happening with streamflow in 24-hour increments. As streamflow responds, for example, to localized rainfall, it is possible to see a short-term response in streamflow, with red dots (low flow) changing to green dots (more normal flow). More often than not, the streamflow response is short-lived, and the next day&rsquo;s flow color will in all likelihood revert to a brown or red color, unless the rainfall persists. \r\n<p>Planned future enhancements to the USGS online daily streamflow map will be to provide the ability for a customer to click on individual \"dots\" on the map and go directly to the specific flow information for that streamflow gaging station. \r\n<p>Customers for streamflow information have had access to near real-time streamflow for about 4,600 telemetered stations in the USGS network of nearly 7,000 stations by going to <WATER.USGS.GOV>clicking on \"Real-Time.\" This will take a user to current streamflow conditions (updated generally at 4-hour intervals) and to hydrographs (graphs that plot current flow against long-term records).

More than one-half of agricultural and urban streams sampled had concentrations of at least one pesticide that exceeded a guideline for the protection of aquatic life. \r\n<p>The potential risk to people and to aquatic life can only be partially addressed, based on available standards and guidelines. The health picture is made more complex by the lack of standards or guidelines for many pesticides and their \"breakdown\" products or metabolites. Adding to the complexity is the fact that existing standards and guidelines were developed for individual chemicals and do not take into account exposure to mixtures of chemicals and seasonal pulses of high concentrations. \r\n<p>USGS analysis of almost every stream sample and about one-half of the well samples detected the presence of two or more pesticides. The ability of the USGS to \"detect\" these chemicals in water samples does not automatically translate into impacts on human or aquatic health. (The level of accuracy demanded by the USGS to assess the effects on water quality is a minute amount -- sometimes parts per trillion -- that is well below the threshold used for setting standards and guidelines.) \r\n<p>In addition, potential effects on reproductive, nervous and immune systems, as well as on chemically sensitive individuals, are not yet well understood. For example, some of the most frequently detected pesticides are suspected endocrine disrupters that have potential to affect reproduction or development of aquatic organisms or wildlife by interfering with natural hormones. \r\n<p>\"Despite considerable progress in the four decades since Rachel Carson warned the nation of the risks posed by environmental contaminants, a large range of nutrients and other contaminants continue to enter our waterways, said Mark Schaefer, deputy assistant secretary for water and science at the Interior Department, in commenting on the report. \r\n<p>\"The President&rsquo;s Clean Water Action Plan lays out a blueprint for addressing the nation&rsquo;s water-quality problems,\" Schaefer said. \"The challenge is to find ways to work cooperatively to reduce urban and agricultural contaminants on a watershed-by-watershed basis. \r\n<p>Schaefer pointed to the report&rsquo;s implication that understanding patterns of contamination in relation to land use, pesticide use and the natural characteristics of hydrologic systems can help reduce the amounts of pesticides that reach streams and ground water.

In the last month, at least 10 fatalities have resulted from rockfalls in Hawaii, Colorado, and California. On May 9, a rockfall at Sacred Falls State Park in Hawaii killed eight sightseers and injured more than 30 others. In mid-May, plummeting rocks killed a woman along Interstate 70 near Georgetown, Colo. And recently, on June 13, 525 tons of plunging rocks fell near Curry Village at Yosemite National Park, Calif., leaving one 22-year-old rock climber dead and injuring several others. \r\n<p>The geologic features that make Yosemite Valley such a special visual experience are the same that make it hazardous. The Village area in Yosemite Valley is built on the debris of prehistoric rockfalls. Employee housing located there continues to be threatened. According to Dr. Gerald Wieczorek, USGS geologist, \"The natural cracking and shearing of the beautiful, but potentially deadly, granite bodes more rockfall events, probably in the near future.\" Dr. Wieczorek&rsquo;s observations are based on a June 14-16 site visit and his studies of historic landslides of the Yosemite area. Dr. Wieczorek has worked closely with the National Park Service as they monitor the area and provide for the safety of park visitors and employees. \r\n<p>The Yosemite National Park rockfalls are a common phenomenon closely watched and studied by Dr. Wieczorek and other USGS landslide experts. Sculpted by glaciers, the valley is a bowl surrounded by walls of sheer granite. Glacier Point, the site of the most recent rockfalls, rises more than 3,000 feet from the valley floor to a height of 7,214 feet above sea level. \r\n<p>Landslides affect all 50 states and the U.S. territories. At least half of the states, including Alaska and Hawaii, have significant problems. World-wide, landslides are responsible for at least 600 deaths annually, and in the 20th century catastrophic landslides have destroyed entire villages, killing upwards of 20,000 people at a time. Landslides, flows, collapses, and other forms of ground failure are a hazard that virtually all states have in common. Ohio, New York, Utah, Montana, and Kentucky have had numerous run-ins with landslides, as well as those states that have highly populated areas on high bluffs along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. The wildfire and rainfall cycle intensifies the hazards of landslides and debris flows in many western states, such as New Mexico, California, and Colorado. These geologic threats are not limited to the coastal and high mountain areas of the country. In June of 1995, a series of severe thunderstorms with heavy rainfall caused landslides, debris flows, and flooding in Madison County, Virginia, where an estimated 1,700-2,000 houses were badly damaged or destroyed. \r\n<p>The economic costs of landslides in the U.S. are conservatively estimated between $1 and $2 billion with 25 to 50 casualties per year.

The same has been assumed to be true for fire suppresion in shrublands. However, a recent USGS study has found that urban sprawl -- not fire suppression -- is largely responsible for the wildfires that occur in the shrublands of southern and central-coastal California. \r\n<p>The study has major implications in this region of the state because of the rising loss of lives and property due to shrubland wildfires, which has caused the state&rsquo;s resource managers and the public to become increasingly concerned with solving the problem of wildfire destruction. \r\n<p>A recent article in the journal Science refutes the view that fire suppression in shrublands of southern and central-coastal California has led to catastrophic wildfires. To the contrary, in \"Reexamining Fire Suppression Impacts on Brushland Fire Regimes,\" U.S. Geological Survey scientist Jon Keeley of the USGS Western Ecological Research Center in Sacramento and his colleagues C. J. Fotheringham of California State University, Los Angeles, and Marco Morais, formerly of Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, reinforced an earlier view that the problem of wildfire destruction started with population growth into the foothills. \r\n<p>The authors found that fire suppression plays a role in limiting the impacts of shrubland wildfires. In the last 50 years, humans have greatly increased the frequency of fires, beyond the limits of the ability of the native shrublands to rebound from the effects of these fires, said Keeley. Consequently, native shrublands are being replaced or converted to nonnative or exotic grasslands. Fire suppression counteracts this impact by extinguishing the many fires started by people. \r\n<p>In their article, the authors concluded that wildfire management should focus on strategic locations instead of on the chaparral landscape at large. Intensive management, said Keeley and his colleagues, should occur at buffer zones where urban lands and wildlands meet. They suggested that buffer zones be selected based on the landscape features that the worst wildfires predictably follow. However, they warned that even with such management, ecological impacts may be enormous because of the already-extensive size of the still-growing urban-wildland buffer zones. \r\n<p>Two views exist regarding the primary cause for the frequent devastating fires that occur in many counties in California, said Keeley. The first, dating from the 1950s, cites urban expansion and lack of adequate zoning regulations as the cause of the problem. By the 1970s, though, an alternate view emerged that fire suppression was the primary cause of increased losses due to shrubland wildfires. The scientific community widely believed that state and federal fire suppression programs have allowed fire fuels of thick underbrush to accumulate, leading to fewer but larger and more intense wildfires. \r\n<p>Based on this line of reasoning, many scientists have argued that a link exists between fire size and fire suppression. They blamed large wildfires on fire suppression and hypothesized that wildfires could be prevented by creating a landscape patchwork of different-aged vegetation. They asserted that fire suppression has resulted in fewer fires than in the past, that fires are now larger and of higher intensity, and that large fires result from shrub stands that are very old. In addition, they said that there has been a decline in the total area burned by these fires when compared with fires that occurred under more natural historical fire patterns. \r\n<p>\"These hypotheses are undocumented,\" said Keeley. \"In fact, large high-intensity wildfires are a natural feature of the chaparral landscape, and there is no evidence they are an artifact of modern fire suppression practices.\" \r\n<p","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"928987200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169442"},{"tid":"169755"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River are feeling the lack of April and May showers","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>All-time record low river flows into the Chesapeake Bay were recorded for May, according to hydrologists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

This could encourage the growth of oyster diseases and increase the abundance of jellyfish during the summer. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>If low-flow conditions persist, other impacts that may be noticed in the shorter term or become more obvious include: \r\n<p>&middot; Small hydroelectric operations may have less water to use for the generation of electricity because required biotic-release flow levels downstream must be maintained. \r\n<p>&middot; Recreational boating will be adversely affected, particularly canoeing on smaller streams, but also canoeing, commercial rafting, and tubing on larger streams. White-water recreation will be particularly affected as water behind dams is preserved for other uses. \r\n<p>&middot; In low-gradient streams such as those on Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore and in most of Delaware, salinity levels will be higher further upstream, which could have general ecological impacts in the streams and adjacent wetlands. Freshwater may not be as available to some farmers who irrigate by pumping from streams. \r\n<p>&middot; The local movement of fish may be impeded in small streams as riffles become too shallow or other controlling features become exposed. These movements are required by fish to adjust to short-term fluctuations in water conditions, such as daytime temperature increases or pollutant inputs. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Real-time streamflow data, both tabled and graphed, for Maryland and Delaware may be viewed on the web at <a href=\"http:\/\/md.usgs.gov\/realtime\">http:\/\/md.usgs.gov\/realtime <\/a>.

They presented their views today (June 2) at the spring meeting of American Geophysical Union in Boston. \r\n<p>\"There is no evidence at Yucca Mountain, based on the distribution of calcite and opal, that water has ever flooded the potential repository area,\" said James Paces, a USGS scientist from Denver, Colo. Paces described cavities in the volcanic mountain&rsquo;s interior as being relatively free of deposits of calcite and opal, and where they are found these deposits are restricted mostly to the lower surfaces. \"If water had filled the cavities, minerals would have been deposited on the walls and ceilings as well,\" Paces said. \"Instead, our data indicate that the minerals formed from thin films of water flowing downward into open spaces.\" \r\n<p>The long-term hydrologic stability of Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev., is an important factor in evaluating it as a potential site for storing nuclear waste. The mountain is comprised of a thick accumulation of 11-to 13-million-year-old volcanic rocks, 1600 to 2300 feet of which are above the present-day water table. \r\n<p>Because the USGS scientists know how much water is necessary for calcite and opal deposits to form over a given period of time, they were able to determine how much or how little water had seeped through the mountain by measuring the deposits of these two minerals. \"In an exploratory tunnel 650 to 950 feet below the land surface and 950 feet above the water table, calcite and opal were found in less than 10 percent of the fractures and cavities,\" Paces said.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"928209600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Study Confirms an Urban Air-Pollution Problem at Mount Rainier National Park","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>NOTE TO NEWS EDITORS: Reproducible photos for this release may be found at: \n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/biology.usgs.gov\/pr\/newsrelease\/1999\/5-28a.tif\">http:\/\/biology.usgs.gov\/pr\/newsrelease\/1999\/5-28a.tif <\/a>A National Park Service employee changes an ozone sampler in Mount Rainier National Park.

Photo courtesy of USGS.) \r\n<p>The scenery is spectacular, but don&rsquo;t go for the pure mountain air. According to a recently published study, air in Washington&rsquo;s Mount Rainier National Park contains higher concentrations of ozone, a major component of air pollution, than nearby urban areas. This means local rural residents and park visitors, as well as the beautiful forests, wetlands and alpine meadows of the park, are being exposed to elevated levels of this pollutant, especially during those warm summer days that favor the production of ozone. \r\n<p>The study, by Dr. David Peterson of the USGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, was published in the scientific journal \"Atmospheric Environment,\" and adds to the growing body of evidence that protected areas such as national parks are vulnerable to pollution from outside sources. The ozone at Mt. Rainier, for example, is blown in from Seattle and other urban centers in western Washington. \r\n<p>Ozone is a natural component of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, but its effects vary depending on where and in what concentration it occurs. High above the Earth&rsquo;s surface, in the stratosphere, a protective layer of ozone screens the earth from biologically harmful frequencies of ultraviolet radiation. The stratospheric ozone layer is essential to the existence of many forms of life. \r\n<p>However in the lower part of the atmosphere, called the troposphere, human-produced ozone can be a dangerous pollutant. The colorless gas is formed from byproducts released during the burning of fossil fuels, and can be toxic to both plants and animals, including humans, even at fairly low concentrations. \r\n<p>\"It&rsquo;s well documented that both periodic episodes of high ozone exposure and chronic moderate ozone exposure can be harmful to plants,\" said Peterson. \"We know this from other regions of North America including national parks such as Sequoia and Great Smoky Mountains.\" \r\n<p>Sources of ozone-producing compounds, including automobile exhaust and fuel-burning industries, tend to be concentrated in urban areas. But the common assumption that ozone pollution is strictly an urban problem is proving to be false, Peterson said. \r\n<p>Peterson and his students monitored ozone at Mount Rainier National Park from 1993 to 1997, and quantified the spatial distribution of this pollutant throughout western Washington in 1996. The park consistently had the highest average weekly levels of tropospheric ozone measured anywhere in the state. Ozone concentrations tend to increase at higher altitudes, partly because of passive dispersion from the stratosphere, but largely due to the transport of pollutants by prevailing winds inland from urban sources, such as the Seattle metropolitan area. \r\n<p>A common visitor destination in the park, known as Paradise, is on the southern slope of Mount Rainier at an elevation of 5,400 feet and a distance of about 60 miles from Seattle. Peterson said that Paradise had almost twice the monthly mean ozone concentration as Lake Sammamish, which is near sea level and less than ten miles east of Seattle. \r\n<p>Mount Rainier National Park resource manager Barbara Samora said the ozone study \"is just one more indication of how difficult it is to protect our national parks. It isn&rsquo;t a simple matter of telling people to stay on footpaths or of sensibly locating campgrounds and parking lots.

A number of resources are being mobilized to address this issue, particularly following the recent signing of a presidential executive order on invasive species. \r\n<p>Non-native, or nonindigenous, species, are those which have established populations outside their native range. Many non-native fish in the United States were introduced by deliberate stocking, others have spread through releases of live bait or unwanted aquarium pets, or arrived in ballast water discharged from ships. \r\n<p>The new book provides detailed information on more than 500 non-native fish species, including methods of introduction, ecological and economic impacts, range maps and identification aids. \"It represents the state of our current knowledge of nonindigenous fishes, and fills a large void by consolidating previously scattered information,\" says co-author Dr. Leo Nico, a biologist with the USGS Florida Caribbean Science Center in Gainesville, Fla. \r\n<p>Over the past 50 years the number of introductions of non-native fishes has increased dramatically as a result of the rapid expansion of travel and international shipping, as well as the increased interest in the aquarium fishes. About 40 percent of U.S. non-native fish species come from foreign countries; the rest are species that have spread into new environments outside of their native U.S. geographic range. \"Many of these transplants are just as bad or worse than those from foreign countries,\" says Pam Fuller, another co-author of the book and a USGS scientist in Florida. \r\n<p>Scientists believe that non-native species were a factor in 24 of the 30 known cases of a native fish species becoming extinct. USGS Chief Biologist Dr. Denny Fenn says that the effects of invasive fishes on endangered species and aquatic biodiversity will likely increase in the next 25 years. \"They can and do impact entire ecosystems,\" Fenn says. \r\n<p>Examples of systems affected by exotic fish species, including: \r\n<p>* The Great Lakes, where populations of the introduced ruffe and round goby are exploding and where introduced sea lampreys, which parasitize other fishes, have been implicated in the collapse of the lake trout fishery. Ruffe and round goby were introduced to the Great Lakes via ship ballast water, and the sea lamprey entered through the Welland Canal. \r\n<p>* The Desert Southwest, where a number of small endangered fish species such as sunfishes, catfishes, and bullheads, are being wiped out by stocked largemouth bass and other species. \r\n<p>* South Florida, where populations of Asian swamp eel were discovered in 1998 in several locations, including just outside the Everglades. These fish, which are sold in the aquarium trade and which may have escaped or been released into the state&rsquo;s waters by aquarists, are voracious predators that could threaten a number of native species. \r\n<p>While many state agencies still stock nonindigenous species for sport fishing, Fuller says there is a price to pay for introducing any fish into waters where they did not evolve. Non-native fish often prey on native species, or compete with them for food and spawning sites. \r\n<p>Another d","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"927000000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169670"},{"tid":"169015"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Finds Palila Population Remaining Stable","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>A small population of the endangered Hawaiian bird, palila, is holding steady on the western slopes of Mauna Kea volcano. This encouraging news from the most recent palila census was announced today by Dr. William Steiner, director of the USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center, a federal office responsible for conducting biological research in the national parks and national wildlife refuges and other lands in Hawaii and other Pacific islands. The Center is headquartered in Honolulu on the campus of the University of Hawaii. \n<p>The palila is a Hawaiian honeycreeper with a gray back, yellow breast, yellow head and finch-like beak. Fewer than 5,000 of these birds exist today. \"Palila are still endangered,\" said Steiner, \"but the good news is that the latest census shows their small population might be more stable now than it was previously.\" \r\n<p>USGS field data gathered in January 1998 indicated 4,811 of the birds survive on Mauna Kea, approximately the same number estimated in 1997 (4,395) and 1996 (4,171). Previous estimates of the palila population from 1980 until 1996 varied greatly from year to year. Since 1996, the numbers appear to have been more consistent. \r\n<p>Dr. Paul Banko, leader of the USGS palila restoration project, and his fellow researchers hesitate to read too much into the latest palila population data, however. \"It is not clear whether improved census techniques or environmental conditions have resulted in the more stable trend noted recently,\" he explained. \r\n<p>Banko, whose research team has been studying palila on Mauna Kea since 1986, said that a continuing concern is that the palila population is becoming more concentrated on the western slope of the volcano -- about 96 percent of the total population is found in only about 10 square miles of forest there. \r\n<p>According to Banko, most palila live on the western slope instead of the northern slope because the forest there provides high-quality habitat. The western slope forest covers a relatively large area, extending from about 6,500 feet to 9,000 feet elevation. The area has many large trees, which palila prefer for nesting and feeding, Banko said. \r\n<p>The birds depend for food on the immature, green seeds and flowers of the mamane tree. In addition, they eat caterpillars found on mamane. Individual mamane trees flower and produce seeds at different times of the year, depending in part on elevation and rainfall; the trees do not produce flowers and seeds year-round, Banko said. \r\n<p>\"Flowers and seeds become available to palila first at higher elevations, then after several months they become more plentiful on the lower slopes,\" he says. \"Palila have a better chance of finding food in all seasons if they can forage over a large area, visiting many large trees to find those that have lots of flowers or seeds.\" \r\n<p>The June-July issue of \"Elepaio\" will carry the full scientific paper, \"Breeding and nonbreeding censuses of the 1998 palila population on Mauna Kea, Hawaii,\" by Dr. Elizabeth Gray, Banko, and other scientists from the USGS Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center. \"Elepaio is published by the Hawaii Audubon Society. \r\n<p>During the past three years, USGS palila research has concentrated on developing techniques for restoration. That research is focusing on studying palila habitat requirements and threats, including threats to palila food sources; translocating palila from the western slope to the northern slope (where they have been absent for over 25 years); investigating factors that cause mortality of palila; and developing methods for controlling alien predators that eat palila or which significantly alter necessary habitat for food and shelter.

In the current issue of the journal Ecological Monographs, the team reports that across a broad array of Central Grassland and Rocky Mountain habitats, from Colorado to Minnesota, areas with the most native species are exactly where invasives tend to take up residence. \r\n<p>The findings suggest that wherever resource levels are high, invasives are able to grab a share. This means that invasibility depends more on the presence of basic resources, such as sunlight, water and soil nutrients, than on an absence of competitors. Conversely, in less favorable habitats, a small number of native plants may monopolize existing resources, making the community more resistant to invasion. \r\n<p>Stohlgren says that previous studies, suggesting that low-diversity communities are more invasion-prone, may have simply not cast a wide enough net. In his Central Grasslands study sites, for example, data from small, one-meter square plots did support the classical view that high native species richness deters invasives. But this changed as the scale of vegetation sampling expanded to ten, one hundred, and one thousand meter-square plots. \r\n<p>\"The pattern reversed itself at larger scales because resources are patchily distributed in the landscape,\" says Stohlgren. \"Nitrogen, light and water are present in some areas but not in others.

Communities with high diversity tend to be in constant flux, creating openings for invasives. \r\n<p>Stohlgren&rsquo;s team also carried out an extensive investigation of the effects of grazing on native and invasive species richness. One branch of ecological theory predicts that regular disturbance, such as that caused by grazing, allows a greater number of plant species to co-exist.

The technique uses computer-processed echoes returned from the subsurface after the ground was struck or a special energy source produced a loud \u00e2\u0080\u0098click&rsquo; in the water. \r\n<p>The scientists looked as much as 500 feet into the earth, using equipment towed behind a small boat on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. In a separate effort they used equipment on land to look beneath three of Portland&rsquo;s residential streets; Rex Street, Berkeley Street and Monteith Street. \r\n<p>The ancient river valley is believed to have formed about 15,000 years ago, possibly when an ice dam east of the Cascades broke and released huge volumes of water into the Columbia River. The valley was carved into the rocks beneath and just south of the modern Columbia River. The flood waters also left as much as 250 feet of silt and mud covering the 15,000 year-old ground surface beneath much of the Portland area. The thickness of these soft sediments, which may amplify ground shaking during large earthquakes, were also mapped by the scientists. \r\n<p>Pratt said the 15,000 year old ground surface appears to be broken by prehistoric earthquakes on two suspected fault zones near the Willamette River. \"The East Bank fault is suspected, from tiny changes in the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field and differences in the depth of rocks in drill holes, to lie along the north side of the Willamette River. The Portland Hills fault is believed to lie at the base of the Portland Hills and to cause the hillside near downtown Portland to be a long, straight feature,\" Pratt said. \r\n<p>Profiles near the mouth of the Willamette River, near the university, and near Ross Island, southeast of downtown Portland, show abrupt, 3-to 30-foot changes in the depth to the 15,000 year old ground surface at the faults. Pratt said changes such as these are expected, if the faults have moved. \r\n<p>Although Pratt and his fellow scientists say they cannot rule out other processes, such as erosion, as a cause of these changes, their location beneath suspected fault zones suggests that earthquakes have ruptured the surface in the past 15,000 years and that the faults are active. He said it is not known how often earthquakes could occur on the faults. \"Earthquakes are thought to be infrequent on these faults because few modern earthquakes have occurred near them,\" Pratt said, \"but our work raises the possibility that past earthquakes are more frequent than previously assumed. Our study is a first test to see whether the faults are active, but it is not definitive. Follow-up studies will be needed to verify the results.\" \r\n<p>Seismic profiles across another suspected fault zone, the Frontal fault, that crosses the Columbia River near the east end of Reed Island, did not show clear evidence for past earthquakes. Pratt said this could imply that the fault is not active, but he cautioned that the location of this fault is not well known and small amounts of motion may go undetected by the seismic","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Oregon"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"925531200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170623"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"PUGET SOUND EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS ARE FOCUS OF MONDAY NIGHT MEETING","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Also available on the Internet at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html <\/a>\n<p>Large earthquakes that have happened in the past and equally large tremors that might occur in the future will be the focus of a free public forum, Monday, May 3, from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m., in the Olympic Room of the Seattle Center.

In December, a record low river flow into the bay was recorded, and several low flow records were approached an the bay late in 1998 as a result of very low rainfall during that period. \r\n<p>The seasonal increase in rainfall since January has resulted in increased flow rates, but average conditions have not yet been reached. Ground-water levels, which have been below average throughout most of Maryland and Delaware since at least October, have begun to rise. \r\n<p>According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, possible consequences of continued low-flow conditions include the following. Water-quality conditions might improve in the spring and summer as smaller amounts of nutrients and sediment are carried into the bay. The result would be clearer water, which would enhance the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation. In addition, levels of dissolved oxygen could increase as a result of lower nutrient levels. Higher salinity levels could be maintained, which could encourage the growth of oyster diseases and increase the abundance of jellyfish during the summer.

Over the past century human activities also have caused physical and biological changes in such rivers. \n<p>Gathering the many layers of information needed to understand the dynamic nature of large rivers, as well as the biological systems they support, will be the focus of a new USGS River Studies Station, located at the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center in Columbia, Missouri. \r\n<p>The new station, says center director Bill Mauck, will allow experts in large riverine systems to work together to answer complex questions about how large river systems function. The emphasis of the new station will be on field studies that can provide the information needed to improve river management and guide habitat restoration efforts for resource managers and policy makers. \r\n<p>The initial focus of the River Studies Station, Mauck says, will be on the lower Missouri River, which has been extensively managed for navigation, flood control and power generation since the 1800s. These practices, said Mauck, have fixed the once-wandering river channel in place and reduced or eliminated connections between the main channel and surrounding floodplain habitats. \r\n<p>USGS research hydrologist Dr. Robert Jacobson says a number of biological changes, including declines in some riverine species, such as pallid sturgeon, have been attributed to river management activities and habitat alteration in the lower Missouri corridor. But, he says, only limited knowledge exists about how the fish and wildlife of large rivers respond to changes in management practices. Consequently, the station will have researchers who are experts in many different areas working together to determine causes and effects by relating changes in habitat to changes in fish, wildlife and invertebrate populations. \r\n<p>Jacobson said one set of studies already under way focuses on two physically similar stretches of river that differ greatly in management approaches. Both river stretches were severely affected by flooding in 1993. In the Overton Bottom reach, just west of Columbia, management plans call for the construction of side channels and engineered wetlands that will be subject to controlled flooding. A short distance upriver in the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, the Lisbon Bottom reach and surrounding wetlands will be passively managed, allowing a natural response to take place. As a result of levee breaches and channel shifts caused by the 1993 flood and subsequent floods in 1995 and 1996, natural flood dynamics were partially restored to the Lisbon Bottom area. \r\n<p>Jacobson says the USGS River Studies Station scientists will compare the managed and naturally flooded areas in terms of surface- and ground-water flows, erosion and sediment deposits and water quality. They will also monitor invertebrate, fish and waterbird populations. In addition to basic knowledge of river processes, Mauck said the comparisons should yield insights into the cost and effectiveness of different management and restoration strategies. \r\n<p>Mauck adds that detailed field studies such as the one at Lisbon Bottom will be used to develop models that can be applied in other rivers and habitats. \"Our work will be useful in guiding restoration in other areas,\" he says. \r\n<p>The River Studies Station will house experts in a number of areas, including fisheries, aquatic invertebrates, ecology, hydrology, floodplain processes and remote sensing. Station researchers will also monitor a wide range of geological, hydrological and biological factors in collaboration with other USGS facilities, other federal agencies, state agencies and universities. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Missouri"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"922942800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170004"},{"tid":"170357"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Abrasives to Zirconium...

Much of this increase in consumption, however, occurred because of increased imports of mineral-based products, especially steel and other metals, according to the report. \n<p>The consumption of minerals and mineral-based products affects all Americans because it reflects use of nonfuel minerals such as fertilizers in agriculture, concrete and building materials in construction, aggregate in road building, steel to make cars and all manner of transportation vehicles, and materials crucial to the communications industry. \r\n<p>\"Summary reports such as this provide valuable insights into our country&rsquo;s use of its natural resources,\" said USGS Director Charles G.

The top three states for production were Nevada ($3.1 billion), California ($3.0 billion), and Arizona ($2.8 billion). \r\n<p>Imports of processed mineral materials were valued at an estimated $60 billion, and exports were valued at an estimated $35 billion. Imports of metal ores and concentrates and raw industrial minerals increased slightly to $3 billion. Exports of raw minerals remained essentially unchanged at about $3 billion. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The outlook for the domestic minerals industry in 1999 will depend largely on two sectors of the U.S. economy that are significant consumers of aluminum, cement, copper, crushed stone, glass, sand and gravel, and steel.

According to a USGS wildlife disease specialist, this is the first time the new disease, called avian vacuolar myelinopathy, has been documented in species other than American coots and bald eagles. \n<p>Pathologists at USGS&rsquo;s National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) at the University of Georgia have confirmed that bald eagles collected from four new locations (near Woodlake, North Carolina; Aiken, South Carolina; and Strom Thurmond Lake and Lake Juliette, Georgia) and coots from Aiken, South Carolina, died from the same brain disease that has killed at least 58 bald eagles in Arkansas and an unknown number of coots in Arkansas, North Carolina and Georgia. \r\n<p>The disease affects the brain and spinal cord by damaging the myelin sheath that insulates the nerve fibers. It is diagnosed by microscopic examination of very fresh brain and spinal cord tissue. Dr. Nancy Thomas, the USGS pathologist who first described the lesion, explained that \"In affected birds the disease appears as open spaces in the white matter of the brain.\" When the coating surrounding the myelin is damaged, Thomas said, \"Communication in the nervous system is impaired, causing a bird to become uncoordinated or paralyzed.\" Thomas used an electron microscope to determine that the spaces are caused by separation of the myelin layers that surround nerve fibers. Using the same techniques, Dr. John Fisher, a SCWDS pathologist, confirmed the lesion in a North Carolina mallard and ringnecked duck, and a Strom Thurmond Lake bald eagle. \r\n<p>USGS wildlife disease specialist Dr. Kimberli Miller said that afflicted birds typically fly erratically or are unable to fly; they may crash land, swim tipped to one side with one or both legs or wings extended, or be in the water on their backs with their feet in the air. \"On land,\" said Miller, \"birds appear intoxicated - they stagger and have difficulty walking and may fall over and be unable to right themselves.\" Affected birds, however, are usually alert and still may bite when handled. \r\n<p>Miller said that the only consistent finding in affected birds is the microscopic change in the nervous system. Despite extensive testing by USGS, SCWDS, and others, the cause of the disease and the route of exposure is still unknown. \"All of the diagnostic, field and laboratory efforts indicate the cause is most likely a toxin, either one that is naturally occurring or manmade,\" Miller said. In addition to toxicology tests, USGS pathologists have tested the tissues of dead birds for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and none have been found. In humans and other mammals, similar lesions have been associated with genetic disorders, certain types of chemicals or toxic plants. Tests for these chemicals in the affected birds have been negative or inconclusive. \r\n<p>\"This is very frustrating for our scientists,\" said Dr. Robert McLean, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. \"We have examined more than 4,000 bald eagle carcasses from around the country to determine the cause of death, and have conducted thousands of wildlife mortality investigations on many other species, and we are accustomed to identifying and resolving these problems. With this disease, however, despite all our efforts and despite the extensive involvement of leading scientists from diverse disciplines and numerous organizations, we have yet to solve the puzzle about the exact cause of the disease.\" \r\n<p>McLean noted that \"vexing\" questions about the disease still need to be answered.

Soil Calcium Depletion Linked to Acid Rain and Forest Growth in the Eastern United States","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>(Note to Editors: As celebrations of Arbor Day are planned across the area [National Arbor Day is the last Friday in April, but activities in many states happen earlier in April], the USGS thought that the following story might be of timely interest -- with apologies to its sponsors, the popular advertising slogan \"Got Milk?,\" may have a whole new audience -- trees in the eastern United States, which don&rsquo;t have enough calcium in their \"diet,\" and acid rain may be the culprit in tree roots not finding enough calcium in soil to meet their RDA of this essential nutrient for tree growth.) \n<p>\r\n<p>Calcium levels in forest soils have decreased at locations in 10 states in the eastern United States, according to a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior. This trend is a cause for concern because calcium is necessary for neutralizing acid rain and is an essential nutrient for tree growth. \r\n<p>Sugar maple and red spruce trees, in particular, are showing reduced resistance to such stresses as insect defoliation and low winter temperatures. These stresses have been linked to decreases in calcium available to the trees. Although the specific relationships among acid rain, the availability of calcium in soil, and forest growth remain uncertain, ongoing research by the USGS, in collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service, the University of Illinois, the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, and Syracuse University, has provided new information on the causes, magnitude and effects of calcium depletion in the soils of the Eastern U.S. \r\n<p>\"USGS research has identified a new mechanism by which acid rain decreases the availability of calcium in the soil,\" said Gregory Lawrence, USGS research scientist, Troy, N.Y., and co-author of the report. \"Through this mechanism, acid rain releases aluminum from the underlying mineral soil layer, which is followed by the upward transport of the aluminum into the forest floor (the nutrient rich organic soil layer where root activity is greatest) by root uptake and water movement. The result is that aluminum replaces calcium and the trees have a harder time trying to get the needed calcium from the soil layer.\" \r\n<p>\"When we took a regional look at the forest-soil chemistry of red spruce trees, we could see a trend toward soil calcium depletion in the Northeast,\" said Lawrence. \"Three independent studies of soil calcium show that recent measurements fall well below those measured 50 years ago.\" \r\n<p>Thomas Huntington, USGS research scientist, Atlanta, Ga., and co-author of the report, said, \"USGS research in the Southeast shows that depletion of calcium in soils is common in that region as well, and that growth of forests may be limited by calcium availability. This situation may be worsened by forest harvesting in areas currently low in soil calcium.\" Timber harvesting can contribute to the problem because the calcium removed with the trees would otherwise be recycled within the ecosystem as leaves and branches decompose. \r\n<p>Depletion of calcium in forest soils may also explain why, despite decreases in acid rain over the past three decades, that stream-water chemistry has shown minimal recovery at many locations in the Northeast, such as the Neversink watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where long-term trends in calcium concentrations and acid-neutralizing capacity (an integrated measure of acidity resistance) in stream water have shown significant decreases over the past 15 years. \r\n<p>The report, entitled, \"Soil Calcium Depletion Linked to Acid Rain and Forest Growth in the Eastern United States,\" by G.B.

Researchers have installed nearly 400 traps in an attempt to document whether a population of snakes has been established on the island, which has no native snakes of its own. This trapping effort relies heavily on the knowledge and techniques documented in the book. \r\n<p>Dr. Rodda and contributing author Dr.Thomas Fritts, both scientists with USGS&rsquo;s Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Colorado, are working to control the spread of the brown tree snake on Guam and to prevent the snake&rsquo;s spread to other islands, such as Hawaii. Brown tree snakes have been sighted on Saipan, Tinian, Rota, Kwajalein, Wake, Oahu, Pohnpei, Okinawa, and Diego Garcia. To date, however, this snake is not known to be established on any of these islands except Guam and perhaps now, Saipan. Scientists warn an established brown tree snake population on any of these islands could cause enormous ecological and economic damage, as well as health hazards because of their bites. \r\n<p>The brown tree snake is an introduced species on Guam. It probably arrived hidden aboard ship cargo from the New Guinea area some 50 years ago. In the absence of natural predators and competition by other species, the brown tree snake has become a common pest, causing major ecological and economic problems on the island. \r\n<p>The snakes have virtually eliminated all of Guam&rsquo;s native forest and sea birds: 12 bird species, some found nowhere else, have disappeared and several others are close to extinction. In addition to birds, brown tree snakes feed on lizards, small mammals, and domestic poultry, rabbits, and the occasional household pet. \r\n<p>Because these snakes can reach large sizes (up to 10 ft. and 5 lbs.) and are mildly venomous, they also pose a potential threat to the health and safety of humans. Though the snake is not known to be fatal to humans, scientists warn that infants and small children can be seriously injured by brown tree snake bites. One in every 1200 visits to the emergency rooms on Guam, a formerly snake-free island, is for snake bite; many are children bitten in their homes. \r\n<p>Brown tree snakes also add a significant economic burden to the community by causing power outages and damaging electrical lines. Since 1978, more than 1,600 power outages in Guam have been caused by brown tree snakes. \r\n<p>More than 15 years of research on the brown tree snake are highlighted in the new publication. Topics include basic snake biology and ecology; techniques for detecting and capturing snakes; the use of predators, parasites and toxicants for controlling snake populations; and methods for isolating snakes through habitat modifications and barriers. \r\n<p>To learn more about the brown tree snake and current research, visit the USGS web site at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbii.gov\/browntreesnake\">http:\/\/www.nbii.gov\/browntreesnak <\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"922078800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169446"},{"tid":"170567"},{"tid":"170130"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Obituary &mdash; Wendy Romney Hassibe","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Wendy Romney Hassibe, recently retired leader and manager with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Denver, Colo., died suddenly after suffering a stroke on March 11 in Salt Lake City, Utah. \n<p>Hassibe was born in Salt Lake City on October 22, 1940.

The rural, central Florida landscape of open prairie, brush, and marshlands stretches away as far as the birds can see, though only a few tens of miles separate the Kissimmee release site from the metropolitan sprawl of Orlando. \n<p>It is a humid March evening when the holding pen doors swing open for the first time. Though the cranes don&rsquo;t know it, this is a pivotal moment, one which marks the end of one life and the beginning of another. At first light the following morning, they will fly from the pen. For USGS biologist Dr. George Gee and other members of the Whooping Crane Recovery Program, it&rsquo;s nail biting time. \r\n<p>These birds, products of the genotype Grus americana, are also the product of modern conservation science. Each represents the culmination of years of research, lessons learned by trial and error, and untold hours of patient, meticulous care and training. As leader of the Whooping Crane Restoration Ecology Team at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Dr. Gee has overseen every facet of these birds&rsquo; lives, from conception onward. \r\n<p>Now, and for the next several weeks, everything is on the line. Bobcats, over-abundant in Florida due to the decline of larger predators such as the Florida panther, have in the past taken a heavy toll on young cranes unaccustomed to life in the wild. Dr. Gee and the team know that if the birds make it through this critical post-release period, their chances of surviving to become breeding members of the Florida whooping crane population are excellent. He also knows that, in all likelihood, not all of the eight birds being released today will live that long. \r\n<p>\"We&rsquo;ve already lost one bird from the first group we released this year,\" Dr. Gee says. \"I don&rsquo;t even count them as part of the population until they&rsquo;ve been there at least six months. By then they&rsquo;ve learned to avoid the bobcats.\" \r\n<p><b>Back from the Brink<\/b> \r\n<p>For decades, tremendous efforts have been made to save the last wild, migratory population of whooping cranes. The recovery team includes members from Canada and the United States because these birds winter at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, and fly north to breed in Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as the group responsible for ensuring the protection and recovery of endangered and threatened species, has been involved with the project every step of the way. \r\n<p>Whooping crane numbers reached an all-time low in 1941, when only 21 birds remained in the wild. Over the ensuing decades those numbers crept up only marginally. As early as the 1960s, biologists realized that simply trying to preserve the Aransas-Wood Buffalo flock was not enough. With a single population hovering around or below 40 individuals, the species was living on borrowed time. Disease could easily sweep through the wild flock, or a natural event such as a severe storm could reduce crane numbers to a point from which recovery would be impossible. (This is what happened in 1940 to a small, nonmigratory population of whooping cranes in Louisiana.) A small population size also meant that some closely related birds were breeding with each other, causing low fertility rates and developmental problems in chicks. \r\n<p>\"To secure the species, we need to get at least two more populations established in the wild,\" says Dr. Gee. Specifically, goals of the recovery program, said Tom Stehn, whooping crane coordinator of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are to establish a viable, non-migratory whooping crane population in Florida, and a second migratory population that will winter in Florida and breed somewhere in the north-central United States or southern Canada.

S. Geological Survey (USGS). \n<p>At the end of February 1999, streamflow in the Potomac at Washington, DC was only 38% of the average streamflow (about 4.0 bgd; average is 10.4 bgd). Total freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake Bay was 66% of average (about 45.5 bgd; average is 68.7 bgd). The 1999 flow rate in the Potomac was the fifth lowest February flow recorded since record-keeping began in 1930. The last time the February flow rate was as low as the 1999 value was in 1964 (about 3.9 bgd), and the record low February flow rate was set in 1934 at 2.1 bgd The low-flow record for February for the Chesapeake Bay is 22.3 bgd, set in 1977. Records of freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake Bay have been kept since 1951. \r\n<p>The seasonal pattern of flow volume in the Chesapeake Bay at this time of year usually reflects a steady increase in flow rate that begins in October of the previous year and continues through winter and into spring of the current year. By Feb. 1, the 1999 winter pattern was obviously different, with below-average flows from October to December. In fact, a record low-flow volume was set for the bay in December. So far this winter, freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake has approached the average flow rate only in January. This unusual flow pattern is the result of lower than average rates of precipitation (rain and snow) this winter across the entire drainage basin, as shown in data from the National Weather Service. Freshwater inflow to the Chesapeake comes from three major tributaries--the Susquehanna, Potomac, and James Rivers--and numerous smaller tributaries. Variations in flow into the bay from the major tributaries, particularly the Susquehanna, have a major effect on the monthly flow into the bay. \r\n<p>According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, possible consequences of continued low-flow conditions include the following: possible improvement of water-quality conditions in the spring and summer as smaller amounts of nutrients and sediment are carried into the bay (the water would be clearer, which would enhance the growth of submerged aquatic vegetation); higher salinity levels, which can permit the oyster diseases MSX and \"dermo\" to spread farther up-bay than in wet years, reduce the extent of spring spawning habitat for anadromous fish, and increase the abundance of jellyfish during the summer. Low-flow conditions might also affect the recreational use of non-tidal waters. \r\n<p>Real-time streamflow data and other information on water resources can be found through the USGS Chesapeake Bay web page at <a href=\"http:\/\/chesapeake.usgs.gov\/chesbay\/\">http:\/\/chesapeake.usgs.gov\/chesbay\/<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maryland","Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"920264400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169651"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Mojave Desert Is Subject of Las Vegas Science Meeting","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>NOTE: Detailed information about the following symposium, including registration and schedule, can be found online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/mojave-symposium\/\">http:\/\/www.werc.usgs.gov\/mojave-symposium\/ <\/a>\n<p>A forum that brings together researchers and managers to examine the status of scientific knowledge about the Mojave Desert will be hosted by the U.S. Geological Survey at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Feb. 25-27. \r\n<p>Scientists and managers will meet at the symposium to discuss their concerns about the large areas of Mojave Desert that have been affected by off-highway-vehicle use, overgrazing by domestic livestock, agriculture, urbanization, construction of roads and utility corridors, air pollution and military training exercises. \r\n<p>USGS scientist and symposium chairperson Jeff Lovich said, \"The Mojave Desert is generally perceived by the public to be rugged and timeless.

The proposed budget will fund research to provide crucial scientific information for natural resource managers at Interior and other federal, state and local government agencies, and for disaster management decisionmakers in government and private sector organizations. \n<p>The FY 2000 budget reflects a $40.6 million net increase over FY 1999 enacted funding. The increases reflect a commitment to integrating USGS&rsquo; scientific disciplines - geology, biology, hydrology and geography - into a more unified approach to research and information gathering and analysis. \r\n<p>The USGS is refocusing $15 million in base funding and requesting a $15 million increase to focus science resources on the most urgent research priorities of Interior land management agencies. These increases bring the total USGS funding directed toward Interior science needs to well over $150 million. \r\n<p>\"As the science agency for the Interior Department, USGS is working directly with the management of the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and other agencies to address their highest priority research needs,\" said Dr. Charles Groat, USGS Director. \"At the same time, we are taking the first step in the complex process of restructuring our budget to develop common business practices that make us a more partner-friendly organization.\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>This restructuring is reflected in the consolidation of appropriated facilities costs into an expanded Facilities line item, and all bureau level administration costs into a new category called Science Support. A new budget activity, Integrated Science, was created as well; this change will help to effectively integrate different scientific disciplines&rsquo; programs to bring a more unified response to critical and emerging resource management issues and challenges. \r\n<p>\"While at first glance it may appear that some programs have received a decrease in funding through this budget restructuring,\" Groat noted, \"in most cases, programs simply have had their administrative costs re-categorized, leaving the research funding intact.\" \r\n<p>Increases include $8 million to improve the integration and coordination of disaster information between the many sources and users of this information through a disaster information network. \r\n<p>\"The USGS provided crucial scientific data for the nation&rsquo;s response to three devastating hurricanes this year - Bonnie, Georges and Mitch. We continue to do so for coastal erosion affecting communities in the Pacific Northwest and flooding throughout the country,\" said Dr. Groat. \"These experiences have demonstrated time and again the urgent need for data standards and protocols, plus source lists for information and materials providers, to get early information to agencies responding to natural disasters in the U.S. and abroad. The right scientific information, made available in a timely way, can help relief organizations and local governments save lives and reduce the costs of natural disasters. \r\n<p>\"At the same time, Interior is the manager of a natural hazards monitoring infrastructure that is critically important to America. These stream gages, earthquake and volcano monitors, and other natural hazards warning equipment are badly in need of attention,\" Groat stated. \"The President has requested a $5.5 million increase to accelerate the modernization of natural hazard detection sensors and networks, and expand the use of telemetry for real-time warning capabilities.\" \r\n<p>Other increases include $10 million to expand the National Spatial Data Infrastructure through the Community-Federal Information Partnership.

In his demonstration, Stein connected a string of various-sized bricks to a small winch with bungee cords. As he exerted strain on the cords by tightening the winch, the bricks began to slips at various rates. \"Slip on the first brick relaxes the bungee in front of it, but tensions the bungee behind it, bringing the next brick down the line closer to failure,\" Stein said. \r\n<p>Stein said this variable stress distribution was demonstrated in the 1992 Landers, 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes, where areas that experienced an increase in the \"Coulomb\" stress generated increased numbers of mainshocks and aftershocks, and areas where the stress dropped had a reduced rate of shocks. \r\n<p>Stein said that while his bungee-cord\/brick connection is useful for demonstration, laboratory experiments on rock samples have verified translation of stress changes into earthquake probability changes. \r\n<p>Stein&rsquo;s talk was one of several in a session on \"Earthquakes and the Urban Environment,\" Sunday afternoon at the Anaheim Convention Center. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"916981200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"TIPSHEET &mdash; AAAS ANAHEIM","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Also available on the Internet at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/public\/press\/public_affairs\/press_releases\/index.html<\/a> \n<p>\r\n<p>Editors: For assistance on covering these presentations contact Pat Jorgenson at the AAAS newsroom at 712-703-0122, or 714-995-5700. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The Gold Rush to Urban Earthquakes &mdash; USGS Presentations \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The environmental effects of the California gold rush and the effects of earthquakes on the urban environment are two of the topics that will be covered by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey at this week&rsquo;s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) at the Anaheim Convention Center, Anaheim, Calif., Jan. 21-26, 1999.

That mercury is still present in many areas of the \"gold country,\" and may have \"significant environmental impacts on some watersheds,\" Ashley said. \r\n<p>In addition, hydraulic mining, which soon replaced the early-day pick and shovel operations, and later dredging, disturbed and altered stream courses in ways that contributed to accelerated rates of erosion. \r\n<p>Processing of quartz from gold lodes, mined mostly underground, used only one or two percent as much mercury as did placer mining, but some of the tailings piles at these lode mines contain elevated levels of arsenic. Hydraulic mining continued, at much reduced levels, until the 1940s, and placer mining is still practiced today. \r\n<p>Ashley&rsquo;s presentation was one of several AAAS presentations made by USGS scientists, on topics from gold mining to reducing earthquake losses.

Goolsby will describe the hypoxic zone when he presents a paper on \"Sources and Flux of Nutrients in the Mississippi River Basin,\" at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting in Anaheim, Calif., on Saturday January 23. The hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico, also known as the \"dead zone,\" has become known as one of the largest environmental issues of this decade. An area of 6,100 square miles or larger lacks enough oxygen to support most marine life for part of the year, Goolsby said. This zone which may contain very low levels of oxygen forms each summer and has been linked to nutrients, especially nitrogen, flowing into the Gulf from the Mississippi River.

We will issue an update if necessary. \n<p>At least 8,928 people were reported killed from earthquakes world wide in 1998, according to the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) in Golden, CO. Although this is a three-fold increase over the 1997 toll of 2,907, and a twenty-fold increase over the 1996 total of 419 deaths, it is still under the long-term average of about 10,000 earthquake-related deaths in the world each year. \r\n<p>\"This is the 5th consecutive year in which the death toll has been below average world wide,\" said Waverly Person, Director of the USGS NEIC. \"The border area of Afghanistan and Tajikistan bore the brunt of fatalities in two events (at least 6,323 fatalities), neither of which was the strongest earthquake for the year or even classified as a major earthquake,\" Person explained. \r\n<p>The strongest earthquake in 1998, one of only two great earthquakes recorded in the world in 1998 (magnitude 8.0 or above), occurred on March 25 in the Balleny Islands region, between Australia and Antarctica. Its magnitude was 8.3. The other great earthquake occurred on Nov. 29 in the Ceram Sea, near Sulawesi, Indonesia. That earthquake&rsquo;s magnitude was 8.1 and at least 34 people were killed. Only ten earthquakes were classified as \"major.\" Major earthquakes have a magnitude of 7.0-7.9. According to long-term records, an average of 20 major earthquakes occur in the world per year. \r\n<p>\"No fatalities occurred in the U.S. in 1998 from earthquakes; however two people were reported injured in the August 12, magnitude 5.3 earthquake in southern Santa Cruz County, California,\" said Person. \r\n<p>Three earthquakes of magnitude 6.2 were the strongest recorded in the U.S. in 1998. All occurred in Alaska: July 9 in southern Alaska, Aug. 20 and Sept. 14 in the Aleutian Islands. \r\n<p>\"A magnitude 5.2 earthquake on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border on Sept. 25 generated the greatest number of inquiries to the NEIC. Although this earthquake did not cause very much damage, it was felt strongly throughout northern Ohio and most of Pennsylvania. It was also felt in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and southern Ontario, Canada,\" said Person. \"We continue to hear from many people throughout the world that earthquakes are on the increase. Although it may seem that we are having more earthquakes, this is not the case. In fact, earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher have remained fairly constant throughout this century,\" Person noted. \r\n<p>A partial explanation for the impression of increased earthquakes may be that in the last twenty years, we have definitely had an increase in the number of earthquakes USGS has been able to locate each year. This is because of the tremendous increase in the number of seismograph stations in the world and the many improvements in global communications. Besides enhancing public safety, this increase in the number of stations and the more timely receipt of data has allowed seismological centers to locate many small earthquakes which were undetected in earlier years, and we are able to locate earthquakes more rapidly. Also, because of the improvements in communications and the increased interest in natural disasters, the public now learns about more earthquakes. \r\n<p>Also, the effect that earthquakes have when they strike is generally more pronounced. Although we have gained much knowledge in building safer structures, when earthquakes occur today, losses (both human and property) are greater in many areas of the world. This is not because the earthquakes are stronger; it is simply because the Earth&rsquo;s population is increasing and more property (much of it not built to withstand earthquakes) exists that can be destroyed in an earthquake. \r\n<p>USGS estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year.

Somewhere out in the foggy night, the radio signal was emanating from a small transmitter worn by one of 320 ducks and geese fitted with these monitoring devices. <!--introend-->\r\n<p>By radio-tracking the birds, Evaluation Project Leader Fleskes and more than a dozen other researchers hope to learn during the next three years what waterfowl do during the day and night throughout the winter. Monitoring waterfowl movements is just one part of a large cooperative research effort to discover what effect ten years of habitat restoration, preservation and management have had on waterfowl wintering in the Central Valley. Information gathered on the lives of ducks and geese in this project of the USGS, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the California Department of Fish and Game, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., the California Waterfowl Association, and the Grassland Water District will help wildlife managers judge whether the goals and strategies of Central Valley habitat programs are appropriate or need to be modified. \r\n<p>\"Why do we care what ducks and geese do at night?\" asked Fleskes. \"Many waterfowl, especially ducks, feed primarily at night. If we observed them by day only, we would only know where they roosted -- or slept. We&rsquo;d have no idea where they go to eat. To evaluate our habitat programs, we need to know where these wintering birds spend both their days and nights.\" \r\n<p>Whether duck or goose, said Fleskes, the waterfowl may move about in search of choice locations for both feeding and sleeping. These two principal activities often do not occur at the same location and waterfowl may expend considerable energy in travel between sites. \r\n<p>\"If a bird must fly a long distance to find food or a safe roost throughout the winter,\" said Fleskes, \"it will be less fit when it returns to its nesting grounds in the northern United States or Canada. It may produce fewer young, or fail to reproduce.\" \r\n<p>Fleskes said the study will provide information on the kinds of habitats wintering waterfowl select for feeding and roosting. It will also indicate how the location and management of habitats affect their use. Biologists in trucks equipped with cab-mounted directional antennae and specialized receivers to pick up transmitter frequencies will attempt to track each bird&rsquo;s location around-the-clock until the birds migrate north in the spring. \r\n<p>Despite wetland losses of over 90 percent in this century, the Central Valley has remained one of the most important areas for migratory waterfowl in North America. Remaining wetlands, flooded agricultural fields, and wildlife refuges from Redding to Bakersfield provide a winter home to 60 percent of the ducks and geese that migrate along the Pacific Flyway, 20 percent of all North American waterfowl. \r\n<p>Fleskes noted that federal, state and private wildlife managers in the Central Valley have long been active in trying to preserve and increase the quality of waterfowl habitat.

Particularly vulnerable are already stressed ecosystems, such as coral reefs, and rare species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker, sea turtles and the highly endangered Puerto Rican parrot, for which the combination of increasing human pressures and the natural cycle of hurricane disturbance can be devastating. \r\n<p><b>Puerto Rican Parrot<\/b> \r\n<p>It is still too early to tell what the lasting effects of Hurricane Georges will be on the parrot, which has been the subject of an intensive recovery effort involving scientists from the USDA Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural Resources and other organizations. When Georges slammed into Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Caribbean National Forest on September 21, less than 43 individuals of this colorful species remained in the wild. Approximately the same number of birds existed in 1989, when Hurricane Hugo reduced the wild parrot population by half. \r\n<p>Dr. Jaime Collazo, leader of a group from USGS&rsquo;s North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, which is providing technical support to the USFWS-led recovery effort, says it now appears that most of the wild parrots survived the storm. \"To date, 36 of 40 birds have been counted during preliminary surveys,\" Collazo says. Two aviaries in Puerto Rico where captive parrot populations are maintained were damaged by the hurricane, but no birds were lost. \r\n<p>Georges was a slow-moving storm that passed lengthwise across the island of Puerto Rico, causing extensive damage to both forests and populated areas. This time, however, the parrots may have been lucky. \"Unlike Hugo,\" Collazo says, \"several valleys were spared &mdash; relatively speaking. One of these is where most of the breeding activity takes place and where most of the nonbreeding flocks are seen.\" He adds that many of the tree cavities the parrots use for nesting appear to be intact. \r\n<p>Biologists caution, however, that the detrimental effects of hurricanes are often indirect, and not felt immediately. Dr. J. Michael Meyers, a wildlife research biologist at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, who has been involved in the parrot recovery effort, says the experience of Hurricane Hugo demonstrated a variety of ways in which the birds can be affected. \r\n<p>\"Food may not be available, and the parrots will have","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alabama","Florida","Georgia","Louisiana","Mississippi","Puerto Rico","Texas"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"913093200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169015"},{"tid":"169410"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Exotic Species, Migratory Birds, Sea Level Rise, Wetlands, and Contaminants &mdash; USGS Scientists Discuss Innovative Chesapeake Bay Restoration Studies in Progress","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><b>Note to Editors: To arrange an interview with any of the USGS presenters listed below, contact Bob Reynolds or Marion Fisher at the USGS exhibit area.<\/b> \n<p>\r\n<p><b>TIPSHEET<\/b> \r\n<p>\r\n<p><!--introstart-->From evidence of exotic nutria damage to wetlands to above average sea level rise, the Chesapeake Bay watershed is a complex and compelling scientific challenge. <!--introend-->Methods and findings pertaining to these and other issues are presented by USGS scientists in poster sessions at the <b>Chesapeake Bay Federally Supported Science Meeting, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, Md., Dec. 9-10, 1998<\/b>. \r\n<p><b>Rising Sea Level in Chesapeake Bay Exceeds World Rates<\/b><br>Tide gauges for the Chesapeake Bay and the Mid-Atlantic coast show rates of sea level rise that are twice the worldwide average. Scientists disagree on the cause of the recent increase. USGS scientists are conducting research to try and address the question of the rate of sea level rise in the Chesapeake Bay and what it means for the environment and society. They are trying to find out if the increase is caused by land subsidence, or if it is related to a changing climate and ocean volume, and whether or not human activities account for some part of the changes. The USGS role in sea-level research is national in scope and ranges from remote sensing and geologic mapping of wetlands to studies of coastal erosion and evidence of older shorelines in the geologic record. In the Chesapeake region, the effort is focused on reconstructing the detailed pattern of relative sea-level change during the last 6,000 to 8,000 years. This has involved a number of activities including remote sensing and extracting core samples of marshes and tributary creeks in the Patuxent River basin to provide sedimentary and biological records of rising sea level.

Larsen, and Martha Herzog, Reston, Va.) \r\n<p><b>South American Nutria Destroy Marsh Habitat<\/b><br>USGS scientists believe that the habits of nutria, an exotic rodent that has invaded Chesapeake Bay wetlands, are apparently accelerating marsh loss in the bay region. Preliminary findings indicate that overpopulation is the key factor in the nutrias&rsquo; destructive foraging patterns. Through a collaborative partnership with the state of Maryland and the USFWS (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), USGS scientists are investigating the role of nutria in the extensive loss of emergent marsh at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The experimental study is using large fenced plots (exclosures) to determine whether removal of nutria can stabilize or recover marsh vegetation. Twenty experimental plots were placed in the marsh requiring 1.5 miles of fencing; an additional 38 unfenced control plots also were established. Researchers are monitoring the effects on vegetation through direct fall and spring measurement of selected subplots supplemented by aerial photography of whole plots.

Although these buried objects cannot be tied to a specific event, scientists suspect that they were left in the wake of Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969. \r\n<p>Earlier studies suggest that substantial industrial minerals exist offshore, in areas defined as the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In addition, gold and platinum are frequently associated with the titanium-bearing placer minerals that this system can detect. \r\n<p>\"We can directly map certain heavy minerals, such as titanium, to concentrations of less than one percent, and we can characterize the upper six meters of sediments in water depths up to about 60 meters,\" says Wynn. \r\n<p>Potential benefits of this new tool extend beyond mineral resources. Sea floor waste deposits, cable, and unexploded ordinance from military activities can cause significant hazards to human health, marine life, and navigation.

Aquatic habitat impacts were not examined as part of this research. \r\n<p>Warren Day, a USGS research geologist from Denver, Colorado, and his colleagues have established the framework geology and bedrock geochemistry of the area. One outcome is that concentrations of arsenic found in the bedrock are relatively low and are within the ranges of the background soil and stream sediment values. A companion study of the surface water chemical and turbidity data, from samples collected in June, 1997, has shown that any variations due to suction dredging activity at selected operations fall within the natural variation of samples collected at the same time in unmined reaches of the Fortymile River and its tributaries. These findings were presented on October 27 at the annual Geological Society of America meeting in Toronto, Canada. \r\n<p>The suction dredge placer miners extract gold from the river gravels by sucking the gold-bearing gravels with river water into the floating dredges, pumping the gravel-water mixture through a sluice (where the gold concentrates by gravity), then discharging the gold-free gravel and water back into the river. A thin (less than 20 feet wide) plume of turbid water follows the dredge, but the water chemistry is unaltered. The turbidity dissipates within 100 feet to levels within regulatory limits, and within 500 feet is indistinguishable from background levels above the operating dredges. The flow of water through the dredges is very small relative to the total discharge of the river. At the time this study was conducted, only two dredges were operating on a 30-mile reach of the river, so the amount of flow through the dredges relative to the discharge of the river itself was negligible. \r\n<p>The management of the region and its resources is complex due to the many diverse land-use options. Small-scale family-owned gold mining has been active on the Fortymile since the \"gold rush\" days of the late 1880s. However, in 1980, the Fortymile River and many of its tributaries received Wild and Scenic Corridor status. Because of this status, mining along the river must co-exist with recreational usage such as rafting, canoeing, and fishing. Violation of mining discharge regulations could close down the small-scale mining operations. This study found no water-quality or turbidity violations caused by the small-scale suction dredge gold placer mining operations studied to date on the Fortymile River. \r\n<p>For additional questions or concerns, please contact Warren Day at <a href=\"mailto:wday@usgs.gov\">wday@usgs.gov<\/a>\r\n<p>Clarification highlights: \r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>This particular USGS study established the framework geology and bedrock geochemistry of the area, measuring turbidity and a large number of elements on the bedrock and surface water.

As a result, most of the trace elements from coal burning are concentrated in byproducts such as fly ash and boiler slag that, with proper disposal, will limit mobilization of potentially harmful elements into the environment. \r\n<p>Despite these safeguards, coal quality is also important to consider in avoiding mobilization of potentially harmful trace elements.

After the 16th century, they gradually increased in abundance, indicating an increase in surface water temperatures over the past 300 years.

By examining pollen from peat cores collected throughout the Everglades, geologists have reconstructed plant communities that lived in the region over the last few thousand years. Natural fluctuations in water level are reflected in changes in the plant communities. For example, the peat cores show drier conditions during the Little Ice Age in the 16th through 19th centuries. However, the changes of the last few decades are greater than those resulting from natural climatic variability. Multiple changes in land use, including altered water levels, disruption of natural seasonal fluctuation in water availability, increased disturbance from construction, and changed agricultural practices are some of the human activities that have changed the Everglades ecosystem. \r\n<p>\"Changes to the Everglades ecosystem are mirrored by similar changes in Florida Bay, such as increased year-to-year swings in salinity since the mid-20th century, which are due partly to changes in fresh-water flow to the Bay.

A small number of seemingly healthy salamanders were also observed, but quickly swam into deeper water. No other species appeared to be affected. \n<p>Dr. Carol Meteyer, a USGS wildlife pathologist at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisc., examined some of the salamanders and found bleeding beneath the skin and microscopic changes in the internal tissues that indicated a viral infection. Meteyer and Douglas Docherty, a USGS virologist, reported isolating a virus from diseased tissues. They are conducting further tests to identify and characterize the virus. \r\n<p>In addition to the salamander die-off at the Utah site, Docherty also found a virus in dead tiger and spotted salamanders earlier this year from Maine and North Dakota. Until these viruses are identified and characterized, Docherty will not know if they are the same virus as the iridovirus isolated from Utah event. Data from these salamander die-offs are still being collected and evaluated. \r\n<p>The health alert asks wildlife biologists to report any unusual observations of mortality or disease in salamanders to the USGS center. The die-offs are troubling to scientists because many amphibians (the group including frogs, toads and salamanders) have shown sharp population declines in many parts of the world in recent years. Whether the recently identified salamander disease is related to global amphibian declines is still unknown. Salamander die-offs have been reported previously, but scientists are not sure how common such events may be. \r\n<p>USGS biologists say die-offs of tiger salamanders were recorded at the same Utah location during in the early 1980s but these deaths were thought to be caused by a bacterial infection. In 1995 researchers at the University of Arizona reported on a similar die-off of tiger salamanders living in stock ponds in southern Arizona. These deaths were also attributed to an contagious iridovirus infection. Canadian scientists recently announced that they too had isolated an iridovirus from a tiger salamander die-offs near Regina, Saskatchewan, in Canada. \r\n<p>Salamanders are a member of the group Amphibia, a word which means \"double life\" and which refers to the ability of amphibians to live both on land and in water. Amphibians, which have been on Earth for some 350 million years are among the most ancient land-dwelling vertebrate animals. The international scientific community has expressed growing concern over population declines in all amphibian groups. These losses are now well documented and have occurred in a wide range of habitats, including remote and pristine areas in California, the Rocky Mountains, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Australia. \r\n<p>On Sept. 22, the federal government&rsquo;s interagency Taskforce on Amphibian Declines and Deformity met for the first time. This group was formed at the initiative of Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to help investigate the causes of global amphibian declines. It will focus on science, conservation, international and education efforts. \r\n<p>Researchers are trying to determine why amphibians are disappearing.

But there&rsquo;s more to this desolate land than heat and sand, according to U.S. Geological Survey geologist Jeffrey C. Wynn, who made three expeditions through the Empty Quarter in 1994-95, the most recent with legendary USGS geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker. Near the center of this sand sea, the world&rsquo;s largest, lies the meteorite impact site called Wabar. Evidence from these visits, the first to closely survey the site, suggests that the impact here occurred more recently than scientists previously thought. The geologic story of Wabar and the expeditions to the site are described by Wynn and Shoemaker in \"The Day the Sands Caught Fire\" in the November issue of Scientific American. \n<p>\"Our observations on the rate shifting sand is filling the crater and the composition of the meteorite&rsquo;s remains indicate that the Wabar event may have occurred as recently as 135 years ago,\" said Wynn. \r\n<p>Shoemaker and Wynn collected samples of rocks formed during the impact. These samples were dated by a technique known as \"thermoluminescence\" by John Prescott and Gillian Robertson of the University of Adelaide. Their findings support the recent origin, suggesting that the event occurred less than 450 years ago. \r\n<p>\"Wabar is important to geologists; the dry conditions make it perhaps the best-preserved impact structure in the world. It is also one of only 17 sites known to contain parts of the meteorite that caused the impact. Because probably the entire impact occurred in sand, it may also be the simplest geologically,\" said Wynn. \r\n<p>Meteorites like the one that struck Wabar are not the civilization-destroying class of impactors depicted recently in the movies. The original meteorite, which weighed at least 3,500 tons, broke into at least four pieces as it descended into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. The largest piece was between 8 and 9 \u00c2\u00bd meters in diameter and struck with a force comparable to the Hiroshima nuclear blast. Meteorites of this size pose a more likely threat than larger ones because they strike the Earth with the much greater frequency of about one per decade, according to Wynn, whereas globally catastrophic events occur only about every 100 million years on average. Studying impact sites helps geologists refine estimates on the frequency that objects of various sizes strike the Earth and better understand the potentially devastating consequences of their impacts. \r\n<p>\"The Day the Sands Caught Fire\" is available on the Internet at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciam.com\">http:\/\/www.sciam.com<\/a><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["International News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"908769600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Government&rsquo;s Chief Geologist Stresses Value of Rocks and Dirt","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Imagine a world without roads, bridges, streets, bricks, concrete, wallboard and roofing tiles.<!--introend--> Aggregates, including sand and gravel and crushed stone are among the nation&rsquo;s most abundant natural resources, have the lowest per-unit value, and are the basic raw materials used in the construction, agriculture, chemical and metallurgical industries.

Their usual diet is Steller sea lions and harbor seals, but populations of these marine mammals recently declined in the North Pacific. While no one knows for certain why these populations crashed, it is believed to be linked to a shift in abundance and kinds of food fish, making food a problem for fish-eating species. Estes said other researchers have reported the fish change possibly resulted from a combination of three factors -- expanding fisheries, increases in ocean temperature, and a depletion of large whales. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>After ranging into coastal waters, the killer whales found a substitute prey in sea otters. Fewer sea otters, said Estes, allowed sea urchins to increase in numbers and strip coastal kelp forests. Estes and his colleagues are concerned about how events occurring far out to sea are profoundly affecting shorelife. This dramatic change in how ocean and coastal systems are being linked may affect numerous marine and coastal species, the authors concluded. \r\n<p>The researchers calculated that a killer whale on a steady diet of sea otters could consume as many as 1,825 otters in a year. How many killer whales exist in the Aleutian archipelago is unknown, but as few as four whales on an exclusive otter diet could cause the declines that have occurred, Estes said. \r\n<p>Reduced nearly to extinction by the early 20th century, sea otter populations grew again under the protection of the International Fur Seal Treaty, reaching near maximum numbers in some areas by the 1970s. When a recent abrupt and unexpected decline in sea otter numbers occurred over large areas of the Aleutian archipelago, the scientists, who had been studying otters there since the 1970s, sought to discover why. In time, they eliminated disease, toxins and starvation -- three causes typically responsible for large die-offs in wildlife. There was no sign of disease in the sea otters, and few sea otter carcasses were found washed up on the beaches as would be expected in die-offs by these more typical causes. Additionally, the researchers found a significant increase in the number of sea urchins, a principal food of sea otters. \r\n<p>\"Lacking sea otter remains, we had to ask ourselves what could explain these disappearances without a trace,\" said Estes. \r\n<p>Having ruled out other causes, the scientists began to investigate killer whales attacks on sea otters. Such attacks were first witnessed in 1991. The scientists contrasted the widespread declines of sea otters in Kuluk Bay, in the west-central Aleutian archipelago, with those of Clam Lagoon, an adjacent area uniquely inaccessible to the whales. In Clam Lagoon, sea otter numbers held steady from 1993 to 1997, while in Kuluk Bay, they dropped during the same period by 76 percent.

In contrast, temperatures were 2 F warmer than present during the Medieval Warm Period, 1,000 years ago when the Vikings established settlements in Greenland, and 5000 years ago were 4.5 F warmer. The last ice age, about 22,000 years ago, was found to be extremely cold with temperatures dipping to 41 F below current values. \r\n<p>USGS geophysicist Gary Clow used high-precision equipment to measure small temperature variations within the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting from past climatic changes. These measurements were made in a 10,000 ft access hole drilled through the ice sheet by the European Science Foundation, using equipment that can measure temperature to within 0.0004 F. With these data, researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and the USGS reconstructed the record of past temperature (climate) changes. \r\n<p>As part of the current debate on global warming, it is essential to establish both the magnitude and timescales for natural climate variability for the Earth as a whole and for several key regions. The region surrounding the North Atlantic Ocean \"appears to be particularly sensitive to climatic changes because of changes in the ocean circulation patterns that bring warm surface waters from the tropics into the North Atlantic,\" Clow noted. \r\n<p>Studies such as this provide critical information about natural climate variability that is needed to determine whether the global climate warming observed during the 20th century is due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activities or can be attributed to natural climate variations. \r\n<p>A copy of the study \"Past temperatures directly from the Greenland Ice Sheet\" by D.

Total per-capita use was 1,280 gallons per day (gal\/d), compared to 1,340 gal\/d in 1990. The USGS has compiled and reported national water-use statistics once every 5 years since 1950. \r\n<p>After continual increases in the nation&rsquo;s total use of surface and ground water for the years reported from 1950 to 1980, water use declined and has remained fairly constant since the mid-1980s, according to the USGS report. \r\n<p>\"If you were to ask people if the nation was using more or less water now than say 15 or 20 years ago, the vast majority probably would say that we are using more water now,\" said Robert Hirsch, USGS chief hydrologist. \"The overall decline in water use is an encouraging signal.\" \r\n<p>\"The nation is clearly using surface- and ground-water resources more efficiently,\" Hirsch said. \"Enhanced citizen awareness of the value of water and conservation programs in many communities across the country have helped to cut water use in spite of continued population growth. Improved irrigation techniques and more efficient use of water by industry have contributed to reduced water use as well.\" \r\n<p>Long-term concerns remain about the quality of available water, however. \"With increased demands for water for instream uses such as river-based recreation, esthetic enjoyment and fish and wildlife habitat, the overall competition for good quality water will continue to increase,\" Hirsch said. \r\n<p>Irrigation is the top freshwater use category--134 bgd in 1995. When fresh and saline water are combined, more water continues to be withdrawn for thermoelectric power generation (190 bgd, of which 58 bgd is saline) than for any other category. \r\n<p>In a state-by-state comparison, California accounts for the largest total water use (46 bgd), followed by Texas, Illinois and Florida.

Some gaging stations monitored by the USGS are used by the National Weather Service to forecast floods. \n<p>A USGS Hurricane Response Team, based in Mississippi, is leading the communications and coordination efforts necessary to assure that continuous information is available to local officials, state and federal agencies, and the general public. During the aftermath of Hurricane Georges, the USGS is assisting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Forest Service, FEMA, NOAA, and NASA to collect water data and assess the environmental impact of the storm along the Gulf Coast. \r\n<p>Gaged streams in the western Florida Panhandle have all peaked from the heavy rains associated with Hurricane Georges, although some rivers in the mid-panhandle, including the Apalachicola and Ochlockonee Rivers, are still rising and are at or near flood stage from lesser rains dumped on the rest of the Florida Panhandle, eastern Alabama, and Georgia as the remnants of Georges moved quickly east and out over the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday and Wednesday. The flood height on the Shoal River near Crestview set a new record on September 30 of 21.40 feet above gage datum, almost 6 feet above the previous record of 60 years set in 1975. The recurrence interval of this new peak is estimated to be greater than 100 years. The Perdido River at Barrineau has in all likelihood also set a new record--it was measured at 38,000 cubic feet per second (and rising) on September 29, about 1,000 cubic feet per second below the record of 39,000 cubic feet per second set in 1955. This also would indicate a recurrence interval of greater than 100 years. The Yellow River at Milligan peaked this morning at a stage of 24.09 feet, almost 2 feet below the record set in 1929. The Escambia River at Century and the Blackwater River ear Baker both peaked on September 30 at flows with estimated recurrence intervals of about 50 years. \r\n<p>In Alabama, discharge measurements have indicated flood flows exceeding the 50-year recurrence interval in portions of Mobile County. The stream gage on Chickasaw Creek near Kushla located just north of the Mobile city limit recorded the highest stage since 1955. Eastern Baldwin County was severely affected by flooding along the Styx River where flows have inundated and blocked access to the stream gage located on County Road 87. The Styx River gage has been in operation since 1987 and had never been overtopped prior to this flood event. In western Baldwin County, flows on the Fish River near Silver Hill are approximately equal to a 10-year recurrence interval. \r\n<p>Early discharge measurements from Mississippi indicate flood occurred at about a 25-year to greater than a 100-year recurrence interval on some of the smaller basins which drain to the Gulf of Mexico in Harrison and Jackson Counties. Provisional flood discharge data indicate floods occurred that exceeded a 100-year recurrence interval on the Tchoutacabouffa River near D&rsquo;Iberville, about a 50-year recurrence interval on the Tuxachanie Creek near Biloxi, and a 25-year recurrence interval on the Biloxi River at Wortham and less than a 2-year recurrence interval on the Wolf River near Landon. The Escatawpa River near Agricola was measured at a peak stage of 22.7 feet, which is about 0.5 feet above the peak of record, which was April 8, 1983.

(The water year used by hydrologists begins Oct. 1 each year, when streamflows are generally lowest across the nation. Ground-water levels and soil moisture levels are also low then, because the replenishing rains of autumn usually have not begun.) \n<p>The record year-long streamflow was set in water year 1996 at 15.8 billion gallons per day (bgd). In WY98, flow was 13.6 bgd, close to twice the long-term average annual flow of 7.2 bgd. The previous record had been set in 1972 at 12.3 bgd, principally because of record-high flows caused by Hurricane Agnes. Records on streamflow in the Potomac River have been kept since 1931. \r\n<p>Frequent rains in the first 4 months of 1998 resulted in Potomac streamflows that were well above average, and above-average flows continued through July. A new monthly flow record for the Potomac was approached in January (when flows averaged about 25 bgd), and a new monthly record was set in February (at about 40 bgd). \r\n<p>In sharp contrast to the above, in September the average flow of the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., was a below-average 1.4 bgd, about 27 % below the long-term average for September (1.9 bgd). This flow is within the normal range of variation for flow in the river. \r\n<p>At Paw Paw, W. Va., near the source of the Potomac River, streamflow was below average at about 370 mgd, which was about 21 % below the long-term average streamflow for September at this gaging station (about 471 mgd). \r\n<p>At 6 a.m., Oct. 2, 1998, flow of the Potomac river near Washington, D.C., was about 1.0 bgd (not adjusted for diversions). \r\n<p><b>THE GROUND WATER PICTURE<\/b> \r\n<p>Ground-water levels in the Washington area were also below average in September.

One record-low September ground-water level was measured in the Md.\/Del.\/D.C. District. The water level at Mt.

The string of islands buffers the mainland from both the wind and storm surges associated with hurricanes, tropical storms and winter storms in the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n<p>Dr. Robert E. Stewart, director of the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, La., has been involved in studies related to the islands for the past 18 years and video taped the islands as Dr. Thomas Michot, wildlife research biologist, flew. Stewart said, \"The concern is that, even if the water goes down some, areas of vegetated land masses will have been swept away on this island chain. When barrier islands are destroyed, the mainlands behind them become more vulnerable to storms.\" Michot, who has been studying ducks and seagrasses at the Chandeleurs, said, \"I have flown over the Chandeleur Islands after every tropical storm and hurricane for the past 10 or 11 years, and I have never seen so much damage. The only things visible on the main island are marshes, and a few dunes and flats of newly deposited sediments. There is no visible beach.\" The entire island is covered with dozens of overwash channels, making the Gulf of Mexico continuous with the Chandeleur Sound, he added. \r\n<p>Michot said that a lighthouse is now standing in open water, about 400 yards north of the nearest land. Before the storm, the lighthouse was on vegetated land, which extended for another 1200 yards north of the lighthouse. Stewart said that before the hurricane there had been dunes higher than the 6-foot high boardwalk near the lighthouse, but that only the very top of the boardwalk is now visible. This indicates that those sand dunes have already been washed away. \r\n<p>The Chandeleur Islands are not only important in protecting the mainland, Stewart said, but they also contribute to a recreational and commercial fishery and are one of the four major wintering grounds of migratory redhead ducks. He said that seagrass beds serve as nursery areas for fish and shellfish such as shrimp and crabs and as food for ducks. \r\n<p>Stewart added that the water was very turbid when they flew, so they could not see the seagrasses to assess their damage. Both Stewart and Michot predict a good deal of burial of seagrass beds in the backbarrier flats on the shallower Chandeleur Sound side of the islands. \r\n<p>Wintering redhead ducks are almost totally dependent on shoalgrass, one of the five seagrass species present on the islands. Michot said, \"If shoalgrasses are wiped out on the Chandeleurs, 20,000 redhead ducks that usually winter there will need to find other winter sites along the Gulf Coast in Florida, Texas or Mexico.\" \r\n<p>Researchers at the National Wetlands Research Center plan to fly back over the island soon and begin mapping and monitoring the islands and their seagrass beds.

The hurricane made landfall in Humacao and exited through Hormigueros, tearing a path along the central part of Puerto Rico*. Not since hurricanes San Felipe in 1928 and San Ciprian in 1932, had the island been bisected lengthwise by the path of a hurricane. \n<p>\r\n<p>Hurricane Georges produced heavy rains over Puerto Rico, especially in the interior of the island. The U.S. Geological Survey raingage network* reported 24-hour rainfall totals that ranged from less than 5 inches in most of northern Puerto Rico to about 25 inches at Jayuya near the island&rsquo;s geographic center. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Hurricane Georges caused tremendous damage to the infrastructure of Puerto Rico. According to Government officials, 99.5 percent of the population was left without electricity, 77.2 percent without water, and 24 percent without telephone service. Many municipalities in the central part of Puerto Rico were isolated from the rest of the island because of bridges that were swept away and broken trees blocking the roads. Numerous landslides have been reported throughout the island. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS continues to play an important role in providing scientific information before, during, and after the passage of hurricanes. The USGS maintains a network of 123 near real-time gaging stations in Puerto Rico for measuring river stage (height) and discharge (volume), lake elevations, and precipitation. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>This network transmits data via satellite to a receiving station in the USGS Caribbean District office in Guaynabo. During normal operations these stations transmit every 4 hours and the data is available to the general public on the Internet (<a href=\"http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/dprsj1.er.usgs.gov<\/a>). This information is used to forecast water availability for drinking water supply and for agricultural and industrial uses. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>During storm events, the stations go into an alert mode and transmit on a special channel every 5 minutes. The information received is vital for emergency decisions by the Government of Puerto Rico. As soon as the stations detect a rapid rise in the stage of the river, government officials can use the information for emergency management purposes. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>At Lake Carra\u00c3\u00adzo (Lago Lo\u00c3\u00adza), an entire network has been designed to collect precipitation data that is fed into a hydraulic streamflow routing model to generate hydrographs at different stations upstream of the reservoir so that the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) will be able to predict how much water will enter the reservoir and thus determine the release that must be made from the dam. This is very important because lake Carra\u00c3\u00adzo is the major public water supply source for the San Juan metropolitan area. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The USGS has developed a robust system through the use of a cooperative agreement with the Civil Defense.

These fish die-offs in the Indo-Pacific have been occurring since the 1970s in some countries and became a serious recognized problem in the 1980s. In a decade when problems caused by invasive species are becoming increasingly evident, Blazer questions how this fungus may have become established in Chesapeake Bay tributaries and what water-quality factors, including nutrients and dissolved oxygen, may be involved in such disease outbreaks. \r\n<p>In the Chesapeake Bay fishes that Blazer examined, the fungal organism and the surrounding sore often extended deep into the fishes muscle under intact normal skin. \"In numerous fishes,\" Blazer said, \"the fungal organism had actually penetrated to and through organs such as the liver. Future research will help determine if large numbers of migrating menhaden with open skin sores -- such as those caused by the fungal infections -- could stimulate the dinoflagellate blooms, including Pfiesteria.\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Denny Fenn, chief biologist of the USGS, said, \"Although it is possible that toxic dinoflagellates such as Pfiesteria may play a role in the development of fish lesions, our research evidence shows that other factors must be considered.

Rodriguez, to his colleagues in Florida, there was immediate concern about the possibility of severe flooding from Georges in the south and west-central parts of the state. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>These areas of Florida were already saturated from a recent storm that dropped 6-8\" of rain and caused some rivers (including Cypress Creek, Alafia River, Little Manatee River, and Myakka River) to rise above the National Weather Service (NWS) flood stage during the past week. Additional heavy rains and winds, such as those experienced in Puerto Rico, could have caused severe inland flooding and potentially dangerous storm surge along the south and west coasts of Florida. \r\n<p>As it turned out, rainfall amounts in southern Florida were far less than expected. Along the southwestern coast of Florida, tides at Port Boca Grande near a major inlet to Charlotte Harbor were measured to be about one foot lower than expected during most of Friday, September 25. This is most likely due to the generally east to west flow of winds on the north side of Georges, forcing water out of the harbor. \r\n<p>Also, minimal streamflow increases were noted at many small southwestern coastal streams starting at mid-day on September 25. These streams ranged geographically from tributaries of Estero Bay on the south to tributaries of Tampa Bay to the north. A small streamflow increase was also measured at the Peace River at Arcadia starting in the afternoon of September 25. In the northeastern part of Florida Bay, water levels lowered more than 0.5 feet in advance of Hurricane Georges, rose from 0.9 to 2.6 feet during the brunt of the storm, and receded to levels of a week earlier approximately 12 hours after reaching peak levels. \r\n<p>Due to lower rainfall amounts than were expected, the USGS has turned its attention from monitoring potentially severe flood conditions (critical for local officials in terms of saving lives and property) to the effects of Georges not only on the topography of the Florida coastline but also on the biota of the delicate ecosystem in South Florida. \r\n<p>In June, 1998, in an attempt to establish pre-storm, or \"baseline\", conditions, the USGS conducted a low altitude aerial video of the entire length of the Florida keys. If storm effects are considered severe enough, the same area will be videotaped again to reveal changes to the natural environment and man-made structures. In addition, pre-storm video and still photography exist for all of Florida&rsquo;s barrier islands and post-storm conditions will be recorded, if necessary. \r\n<p>USGS biologists, in cooperation with other USGS scientists and a number of government agencies, are now making plans to study the consequences of Hurricane Georges on plants and animals in South Florida and Florida Bay. The Miami office of the USGS operates a series of satellite-telemetered gages that monitor, in addition to other parameters, freshwater flow and salinity on low gradient streams from the Everglades to northeastern Florida Bay. Salinity information is used as a general confirmation on whether freshwater is flowing from the Everglades to Florida Bay or saltwater is flowing into the Everglades in response to rising saltwater levels in the Bay. A sudden influx of saline water in freshwater marshes during a storm event can adversely affect the marsh plants and animals, especially if the rain comes after a dry spell. \r\n<p>In addition to documenting changes in beach topography and the salinity of Florida Bay, USGS researchers study the effects of severe storms on mangroves, habitats of endangered species, and coral reefs.

The USGS stands ready to offer assistance with the collection of data to document coastal storm surge, a potentially dangerous and little understood phenomenon. \r\n<p>According to Gerald Giese, a USGS scientist specializing in surface water hydrology in Tallahassee, Florida, storm surge is an \"abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm, and whose height is the difference between the observed level of the sea surface and the level that would have occurred in the absence of the storm.\" \r\n<p>Giese explains that tide, storm surge, and wave height combine to inundate coastal areas. According to Giese, \"Land inundation caused by observed \u00e2\u0080\u0098beach waves&rsquo; is in addition to that caused by storm surge. If, ordinary high tide is 4 feet above ordinary mean sea level and storm surge is 2 feet, and observed beach waves cause 3 feet of inundation at maximum, then the elevation of the maximum inundation is 4 + 2 + 3, or 9 feet above ordinary mean sea level.\" \r\n<p>Monitoring the volume and height of surface-water bodies and assisting with coastal storm surge data collection during a hurricane are only 2 components of an active and continuous USGS program in Florida. In South Florida, USGS scientists participate in an ongoing, interdisciplinary and interagency effort to understand the effects of natural processes (including hurricanes) and human-induced activities on a fragile ecosystem. \r\n<p>Some of these continuing studies involve the use of complex models of surface-water sheet flow from parts of the Everglades into Florida Bay and sediment transport within the Bay. Such studies of dynamic processes in these systems assist USGS scientists in predicting, for example, flooding magnitude and frequency as well as effects on seagrass due to severe storms and hurricanes. \r\n<p>Natural resources managers, including the South Florida Water Management District, rely heavily on the uninterrupted flow of water data from USGS gages (water monitoring instruments) during a storm such as Georges. This information is vital in making decisions about moving water from one management area to another to prevent flooding and minimize adverse impacts to the delicate Everglades ecosystem. USGS scientists are now inspecting key gages in South Florida and arranging backup systems to ensure that data flows with minimum disruption during and after the storm, as was done so successfully in Puerto Rico over the last few days. \r\n<p>* Note: Real-time South Florida surface-water data can be found on the Web at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www-sflorida.er.usgs.gov\/realtime.html\">http:\/\/www-sflorida.er.usgs.gov\/realtime.html<\/a>.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"906609600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170024"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Scientist Receives Prestigious NPS Award","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientist, Katherine Kendall, will be awarded the National Park Service&rsquo;s Natural Resource Research Award on September 28<!--introend-->, at the Service&rsquo;s annual Natural Resources Stewardship and Science Meeting in Austin, Texas. This prestigious award is given each year by the Director of the National Park Service (NPS) to one outstanding scientist among thousands working in America&rsquo;s national parks. Kendall is being honored for her 21 years of research on grizzly and black bear populations and their habitats, supporting information-based park resource management. \n<p>Kendall has been studying grizzlies in the vicinity of Glacier National Park, Montana, for 18 years, following six years of similar work in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, and the surrounding area. Currently, Kendall is exploring the use of nonintrusive genetic techniques to monitor the grizzly bear population in the greater Glacier National Park ecosystem. \r\n<p>Recent advances in genetic technology have allowed Kendall to identify species, sex, and individuals from DNA extracted from bear hair and scats without handling bears. Previous grizzly population studies in forested habitats were often accomplished with the use of radio telemetry, which is expensive and disruptive to bears, as well as to park visitors. Through these innovative non-invasive methods, Kendall and other USGS staff are providing the NPS with baseline data on the grizzly population in Glacier National Park and, equally important, protocols for long-term monitoring of population trends. \r\n<p>The selection of Kendall for the Natural Research Resource Award serves as a tribute not only to her innovative DNA study but also her career-long contributions to park science and natural resource management. \"Kendall has linked important ecological issues to management considerations, which has made the DNA project and others she has directed so valuable to Park managers,\" notes NPS Director Robert Stanton. \"She has demonstrated the importance of the link between good research and scientifically valid management decisions.\" \r\n<p>Kendall&rsquo;s DNA study is representative of the types of projects the Department of the Interior hopes to encourage more of in the future. Besides its use of the latest technology to help address management issues, it is an interagency effort, including eight state and federal agencies, and involves funding from both private and government sources. \r\n<p>In addition to her DNA research, Kendall is also one of the foremost authorities on whitebark pine and limber pine whose seeds are a key food source for grizzlies in the northern Rockies. Fire suppression and an introduced fungal disease called blister rust have caused severe declines in these species with negative consequences for bears. Kendall has been conducting research on the pines since 1995 in Glacier, Yellowstone, and Grand Teton National Parks as well as other areas of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Her research has helped inspire managers in the U.S. and Canada to begin restoring whitebark and limber pine ecosystems. She was instrumental in obtaining funding for and is helping to direct a three-year project in Glacier National Park to specifically manage these species as habitat and to preserve natural ecological processes. \r\n<p>\"Throughout her career, Kendall has remained a steadfast resource to Park managers and other USGS partners for information regarding her research and related issues,\" states Dr. Rey Stendell, Director of USGS&rsquo;s Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Colorado, the office which oversees Kendall&rsquo;s work at Glacier National Park. \"Not only has she done and continues to do outstanding research, she does an excellent job making sure the information is utilized for science-based management.

The streamflow gaging stations in Puerto Rico have been outfitted with satellite-linked data collection platforms that transmit streamflow in real time to the main computer in the USGS Puerto Rico office in San Juan. The entire computer and data relay system in Puerto Rico was backed up with a diesel-powered generator to ensure that information would continue to flow no matter what Mother Nature might do. Throughout the hurricane&rsquo;s pass over the island, data was received into USGS computers from the backup system and data has been provided on a continuous basis to key cooperators. \r\n<p>The streamflow data for Puerto Rico and the other real-time stations throughout the United States are available to the public from the USGS via the World Wide Web (<a href=\"http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/water.usgs.gov<\/a> ).

Teams of hydrologists will be going out to note high-water marks in order to make \"indirect\" measurements of the discharge of rivers, to delineate the height of storm surges, to map inundated areas and to document the height and severity of flooding.

Ninety-three percent of all cargo flights between Asia and the U.S. fly this route. This is the \"great circle route\" or the shortest distance between these destinations, making the sky over these northern lands among the busiest air corridors in the world. This region is also densely populated by volcanoes, part of the Ring of Fire, capable of erupting ash clouds hazardous to aviation. \n<p>\"Modern airplanes are designed to operate in environments free from dust and corrosive gases,\" said Thomas Casadevall, acting director of the U.S. Geological Survey and a well-known expert in the field of volcanic ash and aviation safety. \"Explosive volcanic eruptions can inject large amounts of very small rock fragments, volcanic ash, and corrosive gases into the atmosphere at cruising altitudes for jet aircraft. On average, volcanic ash is present in the North Pacific air corridor four days each year and threatens to be present an additional ten days in any given year,\" said Casadevall. \r\n<p>\"Volcanic ash clouds are not detectable by aircraft radar and can drift for hundreds to thousands of miles from their sources. They drift without regard to political boundaries, making international partnerships such as the one we have with Russia crucial for effective monitoring and mitigation of this hazard,\" said Casadevall. \r\n<p>Volcanic ash threatens aviation safety because its intake by aircraft engines can stall the engine in mid-flight. Long-term damage results as volcanic ash erodes moving engine parts, and volcanic gases accelerate the rate of corrosion to an airplane&rsquo;s engines, electrical system, and body. They also cause pitting and brittleness to the windows. \r\n<p>In 1989, a single encounter by a commercial jet with ash from Alaska&rsquo;s Redoubt volcano nearly ended the lives of hundreds on board when all four engines lost thrust power and were restarted only minutes before ground impact. The incident also caused $80 million in damage to the aircraft. During the past 15 years, more than 80 aircraft worldwide have encountered drifting volcanic ash clouds, and mid-flight engine stalling has affected seven large commercial airliners. Since neither ash plumes nor the explosive volcanoes that produce them are confined to the Alaska-Kamchatka region, this hazard can disrupt flights anywhere in the world. \r\n<p>In cooperation with Russian volcanologists at the Institute of Volcanic Geology and Geochemistry in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and the U.S. National Weather Service, the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory monitors volcanic activity, tracks ash clouds, and warns commercial and government aviation groups via the Federal Aviation Administration of potential ash cloud hazards over this busy air route.

Bruce F. Molnia, a USGS scientist who has studied the glaciers of Alaska for 30 years, will describe two recent outburst floods during a special session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Boston, MA, that will gather experts from around the world to discuss the effects of these events on regional environments in Alaska and other sites. \r\n<p>\"One of my field parties was working about two kilometers away from the origin of the eastern 1994 flood. Suddenly, they heard very loud noises and the ground began to violently shake. Unable to see that a flood had begun, the field party thought they were experiencing a large magnitude earthquake. The ground shaking continued for many minutes and the noises for many hours. Only when they were able to climb to the top of a nearby hill, did they realize that they had experienced the onset of a major flood. We continued to monitor this flood for more than a year, and its history was just as dramatic as its origin,\" said Molnia. \r\n<p>Molnia&rsquo;s presentation will focus on southern Alaska&rsquo;s Bering Glacier, the largest temperate glacier in the world. In 1994, two outburst floods significantly impacted local plant and animal life, and modified adjacent land surfaces. One flood lowered the surface level of Berg Lake by more than 100 meters in only 72 hours, when an estimated 5.5 billion cubic meters of water escaped and drained through the Bering River, inundating the river valley. \r\n<p>\"The Berg Lake flood occurred in May, a time of moose calving and significant nesting of Dusky Canada Geese, Trumpeter Swans, and many other species of birds,\" said Molnia. \"Thousands of nests were destroyed and many mammals were drowned. If this flood event happened in the fall during hunting season, we may have had human casualties as well,\" Molnia said. \r\n<p>The second flood, about 45 kilometers east of the first, started in late July and cut a kilometer-long gorge in the glacier within the first few days. It produced peak discharges exceeding one thousand cubic meters per second. These floods are not unique to Bering Glacier or confined to uninhabited wilderness. The city of Yakutat is near the flood-hazard zone of Russell Lake, at the margin of Hubbard Glacier. Significant outburst flooding has occurred several times this century at other Alaskan sites and, most recently, at Vatnajokull in Iceland when a subglacial volcano erupted, producing huge quantities of meltwater. \r\n<p>The session, titled \"Catastrophic Outburst Floods\" starts at 1:30 on Friday, May 29 in Convention Center Room 311. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Alaska"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"904276800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169241"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Storm Response &mdash; Hurricane Bonnie&rsquo;s Effect on the Delmarva Pennisula","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Four U.S. Geological Survey crews will be in the field on Maryland&rsquo;s lower Eastern Shore to collect water-quality samples at 16 stream sites in the Pocomoke, Wicomico, Manokin, and Transquaking River basins.<!--introend--> The amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus that are carried from the land under high streamflow conditions will be measured as one piece of information that may be helpful in shedding some light on the causes of possible future Pfiesteria outbreaks in these areas. \n<p>Additional USGS field crews will measure the level and flow in selected rivers and streams that are affected by Bonnie&rsquo;s expected heavy rains. \r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>\r\n<CENTER>PHOTO OP<\/CENTER>\r\n<p>A water-quality sampling crew will be in action in Salisbury<\/b> \r\n<p><b>When:<\/b> Friday, Aug. 28, 1-5pm--call (410)238-4259 or (410)238-4209 to confirm time \r\n<p><b>Where:<\/b> North Prong Wicomico River at Salisbury, Md.<br>Isabella Street near Lake Street, Salisbury, Md. \r\n<p><b>Directions:<\/b> From southbound U.S. Route 50, turn left (east) at West Isabella Street.

Auroras seen at mid-latitudes are not as dramatic as they are in the northern latitudes, but those who have seen them describe them as looking like city lights in the sky but in green, blue, and perhaps even red. Because of all the complex factors involved, it is difficult to predict whether the magnetic storm will become severe or not, but it is possible that an aurora could be seen over the next few nights. A severe magnetic storm in March 1989 caused aurora that were reported as far south as Mexico. Look to the north, preferably in a dark area with a clear view of the horizon. \r\n<p>The Sun emits not only light but a continuous stream of charged particles or plasma known as the \"solar wind\" traveling at more than million miles per hour. The Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field shields us from this deadly particle radiation; but if conditions are right, eruptions on the Sun can strike the Earth, resulting in large erratic fluctuations in the magnetic field that can cause power outages, satellite failures, disruption in communications, and the aurora borealis. The 1989 storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Quebec power system in Canada, leaving approximately 6 million people without power. If that storm had not occurred in the middle of the night on the East Coast, it likely would have brought down power grids in the United States as well. \r\n<p>The number of geomagnetic storms on the Earth increase and decrease in concert with the 11-year sunspot cycle of solar activity.

One of their first priorities is providing maps of the affected areas to emergency response personnel from local, state, and federal agencies. This can be a difficult task -- it takes roughly 55,000 quadrangle maps to cover the United States and its territories, not including Alaska. Just finding adequate supplies of the right maps for \"Hurricane Alley\" along the East and Gulf Coasts, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands can be challenging.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most map requests come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. \"We rely on the USGS maps to give us the information we need in a disaster situation,\" said Greg Millett, a former employee of the American Red Cross National Disaster Operations Center, in 1996 when Hurricane Fran hit the East Coast. \"The large format of the 1:100,000-scale maps helps us plot the boundaries of a disaster and determine how many households are involved, so we know how much food, clothing, and shelter will be required. The USGS maps contain all the information we need, and they&rsquo;re not cluttered up with extraneous information on landmarks and attractions that most commercial road maps carry.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>While the first topographic maps are being distributed, USGS flood crews are also at work on rivers in the areas affected by the hurricane. The USGS national network of streamflow gaging stations provides data on river stages and discharges to the NOAA\/National Weather Service in real time for forecasting floods.

In addition, USGS hydrologic technicians often cooperate with other Federal agencies, particularly FEMA and the USACE, to collect data on storm surges (abnormally high tides caused by storm winds). Surprisingly, during many hurricanes, flooding causes more damage than high winds.<\/p>\r\n<p>One lasting legacy of hurricanes is vastly accelerated coastal erosion, and USGS geologists have been studying the erosion caused by hurricanes for a number of years. Damage can reach far from the actual landfall--in October 1995, Hurricane Opal devastated barrier islands in Louisiana 300 miles from its landfall. USGS biologists are also involved in making assessments of the damage caused to biota and ecosystems by the hurricane.<\/p>\r\n<p>Depressing as these statistics are, they are vital information for coastal planners and managers as well as property owners.

This mixture of silicate glass and mineral matter is commonly destined for disposal in constructed pits, ponds, and landfills, or in abandoned mines and quarries. The primary environmental concern associated with these disposal sites is the potential for ground water contamination. Uranium is one of the more soluble and dispersible of a group of toxic trace constituents present in fly ash. Locally elevated, but not hazardous, concentrations of dissolved uranium near fly ash disposal sites may therefore indicate leakage and pathways of contaminated water from the sites. Addition of uranium to water supplies is a concern in view of the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) plans to add a drinking water standard for uranium by the year 2000. Join Robert A. Zielinski of Denver, Colorado, for an overview of a 2-year USGS study of the abundance, forms, and solubility of uranium contained in fly ash.

But developing ways for silver phase American eels to safely swim around dams is a critical problem for the species&rsquo; survival, because they typically suffer high mortality from passing through hydroelectric turbines during their spawning migration to the ocean. Over a two-year period, researchers using radio and acoustic telemetry devices monitored the migration and behavior of the eels near a hydroelectric dam. Most eels moved through the dam area at night at a variety of depths, and some were delayed for several days before passing the dam. The results of the study will be critical for developing effective eel passage technologies. (\"Behavior and Passage of Silver-Phase Eels at a Small Hydroelectric Facility,\" by Alex Haro, S.O.

The study was conducted on randomly selected sample sites on and adjacent to grazed areas in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota. The results suggest that disturbance of habitat by grazing animals does not speed the invasion of exotic weeds or produce a richer pattern of native species--at least not in Rocky Mountain grasslands. Rather, it appears that species variation is more a function of variation in natural habitat conditions. This finding has important implications for designing range management strategies and the role of grazing in such strategies.

The study examined vegetative richness in sample plots scattered throughout the park. The results indicate that forest areas with the fewest native species exhibited no evidence of exotics, while vegetative areas that had the highest species diversity, averaged triple the number of exotics found over all the sample plots. The implications challenge resource managers charged with preserving native species because the relatively rare and highly diverse vegetative areas, which were thought to be the most robust and resistant to invasion, are apparently not. High native species richness does not prevent exotic plant species invasions. (\"Hot Spots of Native Plant Diversity: Additional Evidence of Invasion by Exotic Plant Species,\" by Geneva W.

The data in the AGNDB are part of the larger Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The GNIS also contains three other data bases: (1) the National Geographic Names Data Base, almost 2 million entries of names used in the United States and its jurisdictions; (2) the Reference Data Base, a collection of annotated bibliographies used in compiling information for the NGNDB; (3) the Geographic Cell Names Data Base, a list of the names of all USGS cells usually corresponding directly to published topographic maps. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe AGNDB and other GNIS data bases are accessible from the World Wide Web (WWW) and on CD-ROM.

It was identified by USGS scientists working aboard the USGS Research Vessel KAHO during a spring fishery investigation. \r\n<p>Despite annual surveys by USGS and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation from 1978-1997, the deepwater sculpin hadn&rsquo;t been captured in the U.S. waters of Lake Ontario since 1942. Likewise, exploratory fishing in the U.S. waters of southern Lake Ontario during 1964 and 1972 failed to capture any specimens. In the Canadian portion of Lake Ontario, the fish is extremely rare -- only six deepwater sculpin have been reported in Canadian waters since 1972 -- three in 1972 and three in 1996. \r\n<p>Deepwater sculpin are abundant in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior and rare in Lake Ontario. O&rsquo;Gorman said that although the fish was plentiful in Lake Ontario in the early 1900s, its populations plummeted in the 1950s, most likely because of predation on their young by alewife, a non-native fish that invaded Lake Ontario from the Atlantic Ocean via navigation canals. \r\n<p>Deepwater sculpins are native in the Great Lakes where, as their name implies, they occupy the deepest waters. The small scaleless fish have a broad, flattened head and a long slender body. Deepwater sculpins are an important link in the offshore food chain, eating bottom-dwelling invertebrates and, in turn, being eaten by lake trout, historically the lake&rsquo;s top predator. \r\n<p>O&rsquo;Gorman said the capture of this fish is another indication that Lake Ontario is becoming much healthier. The numbers of two other formerly abundant native fishes -- burbot and emerald shiner -- are increasing in survey catches. Also, hatchery lake trout are beginning to successfully reproduce after more than a decade of failure. \r\n<p>\"All of these positive signs appear linked to a decline in the abundance of non-native alewives and a shift in their distribution to deeper water,\" said O&rsquo;Gorman. \"Because the larvae of many native fishes, including larvae of the deepwater sculpin, occupy shallow water, these changes have helped reduce predation on the young of native fishes, allowing their populations to start recovering.\" <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["New York"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"899352000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169325"},{"tid":"169718"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Life at the Bottom","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<!--introstart-->Life at the Bottom of San Francisco Bay is a world of emigrants versus the natives<!--introend-->, as exotic species replace and react to native species and alter the biotic balance of the Bay \u00e2\u0080\u0098s food chain.

Scientists say they suspect the swamp eel may have escaped from a tropical fish farm or have been a pet released from an aquarium. The species, they believe, is already firmly established in Florida. \r\n<p>Although few non-native fishes invade natural wetlands -- instead being primarily found in disturbed habitats such as canals and drainage ditches -- Nico said the swamp eel&rsquo;s biology makes it well suited for all kinds of habitats. \"We expect this foreign fish to rapidly occupy natural wetland habitats,\" said Nico. \"One major concern is for the Everglades ecosystem, not only Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve, but the surrounding wetlands as well. At this point, the best outlook would be if the eel becomes a favorite food item of native predators such as alligators or water snakes.\" \r\n<p>Swamp eels -- or rice eels as they are sometimes called -- were first discovered in Florida waters in 1997 in two widely separated sites. In late summer 1997, USGS researchers discovered a population of swamp eels while sampling fishes in ditches, canals and streams flowing into Tampa Bay on Florida&rsquo;s Gulf Coast. At about the same time, students from Florida International University in Miami netted several small swamp eels while collecting aquatic plants from an artificial lake just north of Miami. By now, several dozen eels have been found in the Tampa Bay area and several hundred in Miami waterways. \r\n<p>To determine the size and extent of the swamp eel population in Florida, USGS researchers, working with investigators from Florida International University and biologists from the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, are actively searching waters surrounding the two sites where the eels were previously found. \r\n<p>In May, USGS biologists found swamp eels in samples they took throughout a major east-west canal near the Dade-Broward County line, including a site near the canal&rsquo;s border with Everglades marsh habitat. Biologists have not found the Asian swamp eel in interior wetlands of the Everglades or other natural wetland systems, but the interconnectedness of the waterways and the eel&rsquo;s biology pose substantial risks of the species becoming established there, Nico said. \r\n<p>In North America, the species is sometimes kept as an aquarium fish, although scientists can only speculate that the species may have escaped or been released into the state&rsquo;s waters.

USGS researchers are involved in the following areas: Esophageal cancer, known as \"the disease of hard swallowing,\" is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in China. In the United States, esophageal cancer is the eighth leading cause of cancer death in men. Henan province, north-central China, has some of the highest rates of esophageal cancer in the world. \r\n<p>\"Many studies have been carried out in Henan province over the past 40 years, but the causes of increased cancer rates there remain unclear,\" said Finkelman. The USGS and the National Cancer Institute are working with Chinese officials in Henan province to determine if a relationship exists between the type of coal being used in homes here and the high rates of esophageal cancer. The USGS is analyzing samples of coal obtained from this high-risk region and comparing them to coal samples from the low-risk region of Geiju, China, to determine which characteristics of the coal, if any, are associated with increased esophageal cancer. Arsenic poisoning in southwest China has been linked to the common practice in this humid area of drying crops, especially chili peppers, over unvented ovens burning high-arsenic coal found in the region. Fresh chili peppers contain less than one part per million (ppm) of arsenic; peppers dried over coal fires can contain more than 500 ppm arsenic. \r\n<p>Similarly, Chinese scientists have linked a high incidence (approximately 10 million cases) of fluorine poisoning in southwest China to corn dried over unvented ovens burning high-fluorine coal briquettes bound together by high-fluorine clay. There is also evidence of selenium poisoning caused by the use of coal combustion ash to fertilize crops. USGS scientists may also have discovered evidence of mercury poisoning caused by the domestic combustion of high-mercury coals in China. \r\n<p>Coal is also an important energy resource in the United States, where almost 60 percent of electricity produced is generated from coal combustion.

Morrow, University of Colorado. Their talk will also discuss conodont evidence that independently led to recognition of the resulting Alamo Breccia as an impact breccia and to dating the impact as having occurred three million years before a Late Devonian mass extinction. \r\n<p>\"From conodonts discovered in impact-fallout debris, I calculated the depth and size of the impact crater to have been at least 1.5 kilometers deep and 75 kilometers wide,\" said Charles A. Sandberg, geologist emeritus with the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colo., USA. \r\n<p>Thus, the ancient Nevada comet could have been as large as five kilometers in diameter. It may have been only part of the first of a series of at least three comet showers that led to a mass extinction of many forms of life three million years later, but 300 million years before the younger comet showers that led to extinction of the dinosaurs. \r\n<p>\"Unexplained breccias in the Carnic Alps along the Italian-Austrian border and in the Rheinische Schiefergebirge of Germany are the same age as the Alamo Impact Breccia and may have had a similar origin. Therefore, the ancient comet showers may have also struck parts of western Europe,\" Sandberg said. \r\n<p>Conodonts are the microscopic teeth of primitive, boneless, eel-like animals. The shape of these animals is similar to that of modern hagfish, best known from the fjords of Norway. Conodont animals lived in many of the world&rsquo;s oceans from the Cambrian through Triassic Periods of geologic time (550 to 210 million years ago). The largest known conodont teeth, found near the town of Alamo in southern Nevada, measure nearly a centimeter in length, but most are not much larger than the head of a pin. \r\n<p>Preliminary evidence presented by Sandberg and his colleagues John Warme and Jared Morrow in October 1997 at a Geological Society of America meeting at Salt Lake City, Utah, showed only that impact-related phenomena, such as grains of shocked quartz and higher-than-usual levels of the element iridium, occupied a circular area 200 kilometers in diameter in southern Nevada. Iridium is an element found in asteroids and comets but not common on Earth. Shocked quartz grains are produced by the force of an impact on sandstone rocks. \r\n<p>The Alamo Impact occurred during the Devonian Period of geologic time, 370 million years ago, when an ancestral Pacific Ocean covered most of Nevada. The impact occurred offshore from a carbonate platform, very much like the modern Australian Barrier Reef or the Bahamas Bank. Shock waves from the impact and ensuing 300-meter-high super-tsunami waves crashed against the carbonate platform and coastline. As the carbonate platform collapsed, blocks of rock hundreds of meters across were torn from the seabed, twisted, and transported seaward. As tsunamis of decreasing intensity reverberated back and forth across the ocean basin, broken pieces of rock and other ejecta from the impact were deposited over the carbonate platform and high-water deposits were stranded in a semicircular band along the coastline to the east. \r\n<p>Small blocks of impact-fallout debris recently found within the breccia of large jagged blocks contain carbonate spherules formed from limestone fragments that recrystallized within a superheated cloud, shocked quartz grains, bits and fragments of rocks blasted","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"897624000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Mud and Maps at USGS Ocean Fair Exhibit","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Visitors to the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s exhibit booth at the Monterey Bay Oceans Fair will be able to \"feel the bay,\" by squishing different types of San Francisco Bay muds through their fingers, view microscopic critters that live in those muds, and view maps of the seafloor<!--introend-->, at the fair, from noon to 8 p.m., Friday, June 12, 1998, in Monterey, Calif. \n<p>The USGS booth will be one of nearly 100 at the fair, which is sponsored by the Monterey Bay Ocean Consortium.

Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and others will discuss whether these naturally occurring processes can be relied on, by themselves or in conjunction with engineered systems, to restore contaminated aquifers for future use. \n<p>Several presentations by USGS scientists will focus on natural restoration of a Cape Cod aquifer. Treated sewage was discharged into the aquifer for 60 years at the Massachusetts Military Reservation. The USGS has been monitoring the natural changes in hydrology and ground-water quality that have taken place since the discharges were discontinued in 1995. \r\n<p>USGS hydrologist Denis LeBlanc will describe how the ground-water system responded immediately after the cessation of the sewage discharges. Within one week, the 4-centimeter-high mound in the water table caused by infiltration of the sewage disappeared and the direction of ground-water flow changed. Clean ground water is now flowing through the area previously contaminated by sewage, flushing away contaminants such as boron and dissolved organic carbon from beneath the old infiltration beds. \r\n<p>Not all the effects of natural restoration are beneficial. Other USGS scientists will describe how natural biological and chemical processes can cause the concentration of some contaminants to increase at first along the propagating cleanup front. Natural changes in the acidity of the ground water, for example, might cause metals on the Cape Cod sediments to be released and, thus, increase the dissolved concentrations of these metals in the ground water. USGS scientists used computer models and field tracer tests to simulate this \"snowplow\" effect along the cleanup front. \r\n<p>The restoration process affected two forms of nitrogen commonly found in sewage, nitrate and ammonium, in an unexpected way. Treated sewage carried oxygen below the infiltration beds, where microbes used it to convert ammonium to nitrate in a process called nitrification. Biological activity in the aquifer now is high enough to consume most of the oxygen flowing in with the native ground water and little oxygen is available for nitrification. As a result, nitrogen species have been flushed out faster below the abandoned infiltration beds on Cape Cod than was anticipated. \r\n<p>In describing their observations and tests during the first three years of the natural restoration process, the USGS scientists acknowledge that the Cape Cod study raises a number of scientific and regulatory questions, such as: Can we identify and quantify the physical, chemical, and microbiological processes that control evolution of the ground-water environment as contaminant levels naturally attenuate? Can we reconcile rates for these processes observed in the laboratory with rates observed in the field? How do physical and geochemical heterogeneities in the natural environment affect attenuation processes? To what extent is information gathered at one site transferable to another contaminated site? \r\n<p>Presentations by other scientists, including USGS personnel, will address some of these questions. Presentations on USGS studies will address natural restoration of ground water contaminated by a crude oil spill in Minnesota, fuels additives in New Jersey, landfill leachate in Oklahoma, agricultural nitrate along the Atlantic coast, and synthetic organic compounds in South Carolina. \r\n<p>Editors: A news conference to describe the work of the USGS and others on natural restoration","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Massachusetts"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"896328000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169826"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Earthquakes Would Rattle Central United States","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>BOSTON--<!--introstart-->The bluffs of the Mississippi River -- though they shielded Confederate inhabitants from the bombardments of Yankee gunboats during the Civil War-- will not protect the current residents from the strong ground shaking produced by potential large earthquakes. <!--introend-->\n<p>Recent U.S. Geological Survey research reveals that there is little difference between the strength of the ground motions recorded on the Mississippi River bluffs relative to those on the nearby floodplain.

The tilting is probably caused by interaction with the North American tectonic plate as it dips in downstepping fault blocks beneath the Puerto Rico microplate and is overrun by another tectonic plate, the Caribbean, moving eastward. Submarine slope failure and sliding of limestone slabs on the northern insular margin of Puerto Rico resulted, and these submarine slides may have generated some of the historical tsunamis near Puerto Rico,\" according to Dillon. \r\n<p>Tsunamis are more commonly known by the misnomer \"tidal waves.\" They are not, however, related to tides, which are caused by gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun. \r\n<p>\"It has been known for many years that tsunamis are generated by disturbances of the sea floor from events such as submarine landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions,\" said Dillon. \"These disturbances can generate long-period waves that begin to pile up into a wall of water as they approach shallow water near shorelines. Our data indicate that the Puerto Rico tsunamis may have been caused by the landslides that appear on the nearby sea floor,\" said Dillon. \r\n<p>Will people in Boston ever need to flee from a tsunami? \"I doubt it. By far, northeaster storms, the occasional hurricane, and beach erosion from the constant surf are more worrisome.

Boston has also been shaken by earthquakes centered nearby offshore, in Massachusetts and other eastern states, and in Canada. Several have caused damage. \r\n<p>Earthquakes in this region are particularly troubling because buildings and infrastructure are not designed to withstand strong shaking, the causes of the region&rsquo;s earthquakes have not been clearly identified, zones of seismicity do not correlate with identified surface faulting, and earthquakes of the same magnitude cause ground shaking over a much larger area in the East than in the West. \r\n<p>The two special sessions are titled \"USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, Central and Eastern USA.\" One session, starting at 1:30 on Wednesday, May 27 in Convention Center Room 104, will include presentations on Boston, the southern Appalachians, and New Madrid areas.

Bird will give a 20-minute technical presentation on the Arctic Refuge petroleum assessment, including results, at the Convention in Ballroom B\/D, on Tuesday, May 19, 1998, at 3:50 p.m. (Mountain Time). \r\n<p>During the decade since the USGS last assessed the petroleum resources of the 1002 area, several developments have influenced the scientific understanding of its oil potential. Numerous exploration wells have been drilled and several oil fields have been discovered near the 1002 area; new geological data have become available; new advances in processing older seismic data have been developed; and the economics of North Slope oil development have changed significantly. A team of USGS scientists spent nearly three years analyzing the wealth of scientific data stemming from these developments and incorporating their conclusions into the new resource estimates. These estimates are of undiscovered petroleum resources and should not be confused with petroleum reserves, which are resources that have been discovered and proved recoverable. \r\n<p>To assess volumes of undiscovered petroleum, the USGS started with basic geological observations and, using established assessment techniques, derived an estimate of in-place resources, the amount of petroleum that may be present in accumulations larger than 50 million barrels without regard to recoverability. Next, a recovery factor was applied to estimate technically recoverable resources, the amount of petroleum that may be recoverable using current technology without regard to cost. Finally, the costs associated with finding, developing, producing, and transporting the petroleum were applied to estimate economically recoverable resources, the amount of petroleum that can be recovered at a given well head price. \r\n<p>Each step of this analysis was conducted using probability distributions rather than single numbers. In other words, the results are expressed as resource volumes inversely related to probability--the higher the estimated volume of petroleum, the lower the probability that it is present. The inherent uncertainty associated with estimating how much petroleum might be present, before any exploration has been done, is best conveyed by use of such probabilistic results. \r\n<p>The USGS estimates that the 1002 area of the Arctic Refuge contains between 11.6 and 31.5 billion barrels of oil (BBO) as in-place resources (95% and 5% probabilities). This means there is a 95 percent probability (a 19 in 20 chance of occurrence) that more than 11.6 BBO are present, and a 5 percent probability (a 1 in 20 chance of occurrence) that more than 31.5 BBO are present. By comparison, the USGS estimates that were made a decade ago were 4.8 and 29.4 BBO (95% and 5% probabilities). The general increase in estimated oil resources results from improved resolution of reprocessed seismic data, which allowed the identification of a larger number of potential petroleum accumulations, and new information regarding petroleum occurrences in nearby wells drilled since the previous study. \r\n<p>Technically recoverable resources are estimated to be between 4.3 and 11.8 BBO (95% and 5% probabilities).

The report describes five general findings. 1) nitrate and ammonia generally do not adversely impact drinking water and aquatic life uses of the San Joaquin River; 2) the potential exists for toxicity to aquatic organisms from water-borne pesticides because concentrations of seven pesticides have exceeded aquatic life criteria at times; 3) the potential exists for adverse effects on aquatic life from pesticides in bed sediment and in smaller aquatic life, especially from DDT and other insecticides banned for twenty years or more; 4) changes in aquatic habitat and water quality have adversely affected native fish populations; and 5) drinking-water sources from ground water have been degraded by fertilizers and pesticides, for example, nitrate and DBCP have frequently exceeded drinking water standards. \r\n<p>Neil Dubrovsky, senior author of the report and program chief, said that \"Although nitrate concentrations in the San Joaquin-Tulare Basins have been increasing for over 40 years, they are still below the drinking water standard. Nitrate concentrations in ground water in the eastern part of the basin, in contrast, exceed the drinking water standard in 25 percent of the samples collected from household wells.\" In comparison with the other 19 basin areas, Dubrovsky said that streams in the San Joaquin-Tulare Basins have more degraded fish communities, and higher concentrations of pesticides in water and PCBs, and organochlorine insecticides in streambed sediment and fish tissue. \"Concentrations of several pesticides in streams exceed water-quality guidelines, and the occurrence of non-native fish species is especially high. Ground water-quality in the San Joaquin-Tulare Basins is generally poor compared with the other 19 basins,\" Dubrovsky added. \"Detections and concentrations of nitrate and pesticides in ground water exceed national averages. In many cases, the presence of nitrate or particular pesticides can be attributed to present, or often past, use of agricultural chemicals.\" \r\n<p>On a more positive note, Dubrovsky said that only two pesticides - both banned long ago - have been found in ground water at concentrations that exceed drinking water standards. \r\n<p>This report summarizes major findings that emerged from the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program. The NAWQA program assesses water-quality conditions in sources of drinking water used by about 70 percent of the U.S. population. \"The report addresses many of the concerns raised by more than 30 stakeholder groups who provided input to the USGS during this investigation\" said Charles Kratzer, USGS assistant program chief. The vital information in this report will also be of interest to regulators, water-utility managers, industry representatives, public officials, scientists, and those who simply want to know more about the quality of water in the rivers and aquifers in the area where they live. \r\n<p>The report, \"Water Quality in the San Joaquin-Tulare Basins, Calif, 1992-95,\" by Neil M.

In a row-crop agricultural study area, nitrate concentrations exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) drinking-water standard in 33% of ground-water samples from shallow wells. However, Marian Berndt, a USGS Hydrologist and principal author of the report, said that \"nearby streams were not high in nitrate, suggesting that the high concentrations in shallow wells were localized occurrences.

Moreover, the effects of long-term exposure to pesticide mixtures are, as yet, unknown.\" \r\n<p>Furthermore, ground water in agricultural areas downstream from Denver is less of an option as a rural drinking-water supply because of the impacts to ground-water quality from the intensive application of agricultural fertilizers and manure, accompanied by widespread irrigation,\" Dennehy said. \"We found that nitrate concentrations exceeded the maximum contaminant level, or MCL, in about 48 percent of agricultural wells sampled. A maximum contaminant level is a drinking-water regulatory standard that is set by the USEPA. Although the wells sampled for this study were not drinking-water wells, local residents get their drinking water from domestic wells that tap the same underground water-supply source,\" Dennehy said. \r\n<p>Surface- and ground-water resources in the Denver metropolitan area are susceptible to contamination from pesticides and VOCs. All surface-water samples collected at two urban sites contained at least one pesticide, and water from 90 percent of the wells in the shallow alluvial aquifer contained at ]east one pesticide. VOCs were detected in 86 percent of the wells sampled from the shallow alluvial aquifen Sixty- two percent of the samples had more than one VOC present. \r\n<p>The most frequently detected VOC was methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive used to reduce carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles during winter. Although pesticide and VOC concentrations generally were small, their widespread occurrence is a concern, Currently, neither surface nor ground water from the urban area is used for drinking water, but better management of potentially toxic substances may be needed to protect water resources for possible future use as a drinking-water supply. \r\n<p>The good news from the USGS report is that surface and ground water in the forested mountain areas are generally of good quality and relatively unaffected by humans. Mining activities and residential development, however, have impacted water resources and fish communities. Wells are the primary.drinking-water source for most mountain communities, but pesticides were not detected in well water, and only one well had a nitrate concentration above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standard. \r\n<p>VOCs, such as gasoline components and cleaning solvents were detected in 30 percent of the wells sampled in the mountain areas, but none of the concentrations exceeded drinking-water standards. The occurrence of VOCs in mountain wells indicates that ground water is susceptible to contamination from development and other human activities on the surface. \r\n<p>The effects of human activity on water quality go beyond the concerns of drinking water--the aquatic ecosystem of the basin also has been affected. \"Surface water from agricultural and urban areas is not used for drinking water, but fish and invertebrate communities that live in these waters are affected by degraded stream-water-quality,\" Dennehy said. \"Although variability in the type and number of fi","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Colorado"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"893044800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169869"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Explore the Planets at the USGS Open House","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Visit other worlds and learn more about the Earth!

An MCL is a drinking-water regulatory standard that is set by the EPA. Shallow ground water generally is not used as drinking-water source in these areas. \r\n<p>Pesticides were detected in shallow ground water in both agricultural and urban land-use areas; 29 percent of the wells contained at least one pesticide. The detected concentrations were very small compared to established MCL&rsquo;s, although not all pesticides have MCL&rsquo;s. Multiple pesticides were detected in several wells; the effect that combinations of pesticides may have on human health is unknown. Volatile organic compounds were detected in shallow ground water from 11 percent of the wells sampled. No concentrations of pesticides and volatile organic compounds exceeded EPA drinking-water standards. \r\n<p>Only two trace elements exceeded EPA MCL&rsquo;s or Health Advisories for drinking water. Uranium concentrations exceeded the EPA-proposed MCL in 13 percent of the wells and molybdenum exceeded the EPA Health Advisory in 2 percent of the wells. \r\n<p>Radon was detected in all ground-water samples. Water from shallow wells in the San Luis Valley and deeper wells in the Rio Grande flood plain contained the highest median concentrations. At present no EPA drinking-water standard exists for radon. \r\n<p>Water quality in reaches of the Rio Grande and some of its tributaries has been impaired by pesticides, elevated concentrations of trace elements, and anthropogenic disturbance. Pesticides were detected in surface water, bed sediment, and fish samples collected at sites in the Rio Grande and its tributaries and drains. However, no pesticide concentration exceeded EPA drinking-water standards or applicable Federal or State ambient criteria or guidelines. One or more pesticides were detected at 94 percent of the sites sampled; most concentrations were at or only slightly above the laboratory level of detection. In the Creede, Colorado, area and the lower Red River in New Mexico, a combination of natural conditions and human activities appears to be associated with elevated trace-element concentrations; however, data indicate that the concentrations tend to decrease downstream from the source. \r\n<p>Analysis of fish community-structure data collected at 10 sites indicates that 6 of the sites show indications of environmental perturbation. This analysis is based on the number of introduced, omnivorous, and pollution-tolerant fish and those with external anomalies counted at the sites sampled. On the basis of habitat data collected on stream modification, bank erosion, bank vegetation stability, and riparian vegetation density, 6 of 10 sites sampled have significant habitat degradation.

All surface-water samples collected at two urban sites contained at least one pesticide, and water from 90 percent of the wells in the shallow alluvial aquifer contained at least one pesticide. VOCs were detected in 86 percent of the wells sampled from the shallow alluvial aquifer. Sixty-two percent of the samples had more than one VOC present. \r\n<p>The most frequently detected VOC was methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a gasoline additive used to reduce carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles during winter. Although pesticide and VOC concentrations generally were small, their widespread occurrence is a concern. Currently, neither surface nor ground water from the urban area is used for drinking water, but better management of potentially toxic substances may be needed to protect water resources for possible future use as a drinking-water supply. \r\n<p>The good news from the USGS report is that surface and ground water in the forested mountain areas are generally of good quality and relatively unaffected by humans. Mining activities and residential development, however, have impacted water resources and fish communities. Wells are the primary drinking-water source for most mountain communities, but pesticides were not detected in well water, and only one well had a nitrate concentration above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking-water standard. \r\n<p>VOCs, such as gasoline components and cleaning solvents were detected in 30 percent of the wells sampled in the mountain areas, but none of the concentrations exceeded drinking-water standards. The occurrence of VOCs in mountain wells indicates that ground water is susceptible to contamination from development and other human activities on the surface. \r\n<p>\"Downstream from Denver, ground water is less of an option as a rural drinking-water supply because of the impacts to ground-water quality from the intensive application of agricultural fertilizers and manure, accompanied by widespread irrigation,\" Dennehy said. \"We found that nitrate concentrations exceeded the maximum contaminant level, or MCL, in about 48 percent of agricultural wells sampled. (A maximum contaminant level [MCL] is a drinking-water regulatory standard that is set by the USEPA. Although the wells sampled for this study were not drinking-water wells, local residents get their drinking water from domestic wells that tap the same underground water-supply source,\" Dennehy said. \r\n<p>\"A complicating factor in telling a complete story about water quality in the basin,\" Dennehy noted, \"is that less than 50 percent of the pesticides that were detected have established water-quality standards.

The study results underscore the need for awareness that untreated ground water may not always be safe to drink. \r\n<p>There was good news, however, about these same rural wells. Concentrations of pesticides and other organic contaminants in the water from the wells did not exceed levels established by Federal and State agencies as drinking-water standards. \r\n<p>Of the well-water samples in which a pesticide was present, nearly 70 percent contained more than one detectable pesticide. This is a significant new finding from the USGS studies. \r\n<p>\"Human activities on the land surface, such as application of fertilizers and manure on croplands, have a significant effect on the concentration of nitrogen that ends up in the ground water or streams,\" said Scott Ator, USGS Hydrologist and principal author of the Potomac River Basin report. Ator&rsquo;s colleague, Bruce Lindsey, USGS Hydrologist and principal author of the Lower Susquehanna report, added, \"Animal manure, used as an agricultural fertilizer, and commercial fertilizers are major sources of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. We now have good baseline data to measure changes as the new Pennsylvania law for nutrient management goes into affect this year.\" \r\n<p>\"The old adage `Too much of a good thing&rsquo; applies in certain areas,\" Lindsey said. Nitrogen in manure and fertilizers added to agricultural land is essential for plant growth; however, a concentrated animal operation can produce more manure than the crops grown on that farm can use. The numbers of concentrated animal operations are increasing in the basins. \r\n<p>Moving from the home front to the river front, the studies also provide an extensive baseline of information against which planners and water managers can measure the success of strategies for reduction of nutrients and toxics in tributaries to Chesapeake Bay. Fish, streambed-sediment, and water samples were used to assess the occurrence of contaminants. \r\n<p>Contaminants in streambed sediment at some sites were detected at levels potentially harmful to aquatic life. Trace metals and long-banned organic contaminants are present in streambed sediment in the Lower Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers and their tributaries and have been incorporated into the food chain. These metals and contaminants were detected in clam and fish tissues. The use of PCBs, DDT, and chlordane has been banned or restricted for nearly 20 years, but these contaminants are still being detected in rivers and streams. The USGS cautioned that the fish were collected and analyzed to determine if contaminants were present, not to determine if the fish were safe to eat. \r\n<p>Being more specific, Ator said, \"Mercury contamination from an industrial source near Waynesboro, Va., has led to measurable concentrations of mercury in sediment as far as 170 miles downstream on the Shenandoah River near Harpers Ferry, W.

The report summarizes results of 5 years of study and 3 years of data collection as part of the USGS&rsquo;s National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA [pronounced nawkwa]) Program. \r\n<p>\"Although the water-quality guidelines have been around for many years, they remain relevant by providing some important clues as to why these two rivers seem to have more than their share of water-quality problems,\"said Tim Spruill, a hydrologist with the USGS. According to the report, a 50-percent reduction in summertime nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the Neuse River and a 30-percent reduction in the Tar River and Contentnea Creek (a tributary of the Neuse River) might be necessary to attain the water-quality guidelines. \"Mid- to late summer is usually when fishkills and nuisance algal blooms occur in rivers and estuaries because environmental conditions are more favorable for rapid algal growths at this time,\" said Spruill. When algae deplete the nutrients and begin to die, the decomposing cells deplete the oxygen in water. This lack of oxygen often results in the death of fish and other organisms. \r\n<p>Although nutrient concentrations in the Tar and Neuse Rivers in recent years have been linked to agricultural, urban, and industrial sources, the report presents evidence that natural geologic sources of phosphorus increase the problem in these two basins. Based on analysis of ground-water and stream samples from areas throughout the Coastal Plain, ground water that empties into streams in some parts of the basins contains high concentrations of phosphorus. Phosphorus in ground water discharging to streams of the Neuse and Tar River Basins is often 0.2 part per million (ppm) or more. Based on published guidelines, streams draining directly into ponds, lakes, or estuaries should have phosphorus concentrations less than 0.05 ppm to prevent nuisance algal growths. \r\n<p>Relative to 19 other basins studied as part of the USGS NAWQA Program across the United States, the Tar and Neuse River Basins have some of the highest (upper 25 percent) nutrient concentrations observed. In general, highest concentrations of nutrients occurred in agricultural and urban streams. \r\n<p>Other findings from the report include: \r\n<p>* Of shallow ground-water samples collected from 49 wells throughout the Coastal Plain of Virginia and North Carolina, 4 percent exceeded the 10-ppm drinking-water standard for public water supplies. Although shallow ground water is not commonly used for public water supplies, it is used for water supply by rural residents in many counties. The highest nitrate concentrations in ground water occurred in sandy, well-drained soils. High nitrate concentrations in water can cause \"blue baby syndrome\" and is the primary reason why the drinking-water standard was established. \r\n<p>* Of the 47 pesticides tested in stream samples, 45 were detected. Themost commonly detected pesticides were atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor,and prometon.

These improvements may be the result of increased use of best management practices (BMPs) by area farmers. \n<p>Areas with intensive fertilizer use and irrigation, such as in the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project (CBIP), showed the greatest impacts on ground-water quality. (The CBIP includes parts of Franklin, Grant, and Adams counties in eastern Washington.) \r\n<p>Shallow wells, generally those less than 150 feet deep, are the most susceptible to contamination, the USGS report says. A reassuring aspect of this finding, however, is that many public water supplies draw from wells at greater depths and are less susceptible to contamination from agricultural practices. \r\n<p>\"From the standpoint of human health, we were most concerned about checking for nitrate and pesticides in drinking water,\" said Sandy Williamson, USGS hydrologist and chief of the study. \"We found nitrate levels exceeding the maximum contaminant level in about 20 percent of all wells.\" (A maximum contaminant level-or MCL-is a drinking water regulatory standard that is set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.) \r\n<p>\"The story on pesticides is a mixed bag,\" Williamson said. \"We found at least one pesticide in nearly half of the drinking water wells sampled, but pesticide levels were only a very small fraction of their MCLs.\" As a cautionary note, however, Williamson said that about half of the pesticides detected in Central Columbia Plateau wells do not have MCLs established. \r\n<p>A lack of information makes it difficult to assess the significance of finding pesticides in drinking water. \"As scientists, we don&rsquo;t know enough yet about what happens when these pesticides are combined,\" he said. \"In some of the very shallow wells that the USGS installed for monitoring purposes, we found up to seven different pesticides.\" \r\n<p>Encouraging news is that none of the newer pesticides, which break down more rapidly in the environment, were found at concentrations exceeding MCLs. Compounds that exceed drinking water standards were found in only 1 percent of the wells sampled-and those compounds have not been sold as pesticides since the mid-1980s. \r\n<p>However, agricultural impacts on water quality go beyond the concerns for drinking water-the aquatic ecosystem of the plateau also has been significantly affected. \"Very little surface water is used for drinking water in this area, but fish are harmed by decreased stream-water quality,\" said Mark Munn, the biologist for the USGS study. \"Pesticides and habitat degradation are the main concerns.\" He noted that stream sampling by the USGS showed seven currently used pesticides at concentrations above the limits recommended for protecting aquatic life. \r\n<p>Soil erosion, a long-term problem for farmers in the Palouse River Basin, transports some soil to streams, degrading habitat and carrying with it older pesticides and their breakdown products.

Using the ATM and a Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite receiver, researchers have been able to survey the beach elevations to an accuracy of four inches. \r\n<p>\"The use of the NASA instrumentation will provide cost effective and highly accurate mapping of the beach erosion which is of great interest and concern to coastal communities,\" said John Brock, Coastal Remote Sensing Program Manager with NOAA. \"Due to the high human and economic costs associated with El Nino, this type of information will help to support sustainable coastal development and improved coastal management.\" A pre-El Nino baseline survey of 625 nautical miles (1,000 kilometers) of the Pacific Coast conducted in October 1997 included three regions. The southern region extended from the U.S. and Mexican border to Santa Barbara, Calif. The central region extended from Monterey to Point Reyes, Calif., and the northern region extended from Cape Blanco, Ore., to Port Grenville, Wash. A similar type of survey to measure beach erosion was conducted along the east coast of the United States in October 1996, September 1997 and February 1998. \r\n<p>The ATM was developed by NASA Wallops Flight Facility and had previously been used primarily in the measurement of Greenland and ice sheets in the surrounding area. Scientists are mapping these ice sheets to examine response to climatic changes in the northern hemisphere. \r\n<p>NASA is responsible for the operation of the ATM and the initial processing of the data. Mission planning and the follow-on processing of the survey information and its conversion into a format that can be directly used by different state and federal agencies will be jointly done by NASA, USGS and NOAA. \r\n<p>Information on the Airborne Topographic Mapper, 1998 West Coast Beach Mapping, can be found on the NASA Internet home page at URL: <a href=\"http:\/\/aol.wff.nasa.gov\/aoltm\/projects\/beachmap\/98results\/\">http:\/\/aol.wff.nasa.gov\/aoltm\/projects\/beachmap\/98results\/<\/a>. \r\n<p><b>MEDIA NOTE: Media are invited to attend a media event with representatives of NASA, USGS and NOAA participating in the west coast mapping mission.

In contrast, only a few pesticides were found in ground water, and these were at much lower concentrations. Pesticide concentrations in streams in the White River Basin were among the highest found at USGS monitoring stations nationwide. \r\n<p>Twenty-five different pesticides or pesticide degradation products were found in at least 5&nbsp;percent of samples near the mouth of the White River. The widely used agricultural herbicides atrazine and metolachlor were always found. \"In a few samples, concentrations of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, or cyanazine exceeded Federal drinking-water standards or advisories; however, annual average concentrations of each of these compounds in the White River were below their respective standard or guideline,\" said USGS hydrologist Charles G. Crawford, project leader of the White River Basin study. \r\n<p>Fourteen different pesticides were found in a network of 94 shallow monitoring wells; six were found more than once. However, Crawford said, \"No pesticide concentration found in ground water came close to exceeding a Federal drinking-water standard or advisory.\" In cropland areas with a surficial sand and gravel aquifer that is particularly vulnerable to contamination but is also an important source of drinking water for residents of the basin, atrazine compounds were found in two-thirds of monitoring wells but only at trace levels. Shallow wells are most susceptible to contamination and provide insight into the effects of pesticides and fertilizers on ground-water quality. Pesticide concentrations typically decrease with depth in an aquifer. The presence of only low pesticide concentrations in shallow wells indicates they are probably not present in the deeper ground water used most commonly for domestic or public supply. \r\n<p>Most, but not all, of the pesticides found were associated with agricultural use. Pesticide concentrations in streams differ according to land use. Crawford said that lawn insecticides (such as diazinon) are commonly found in streams in urban areas, whereas corn herbicides (such as atrazine) are more commonly found in streams in agricultural areas. Pesticide concentrations in streams are highest in areas with permeable, well-drained soils, all other factors being equal. Agricultural tile drains play a major role in transporting pesticides to streams in areas with poorly drained soils. Nitrate concentrations in ground water are low (commonly not found) in some aquifer settings and high (sometimes exceeding the Federal drinking-water standard) in others. Nitrate concentrations in stream water typically are between these extremes. Median concentrations of nitrate at monitoring sites in streams generally ranged from 2 to 6 milligrams per liter-higher than those at most other USGS monitoring sites in the United States. \r\n<p>Soil drainage is a major factor controlling nitrate concentrations in streams. \"Concentrations tend to increase as the proportion of naturally or artificially drained soils in the basin increases,\" said Crawford. \"Manure from farm animals also increases nitrate concentrations in some streams.\" Nitrate concentrations in stream water rarely exceeded the Federal drinking-water standard of 10 milligrams per liter. \r\n<p>Surficial sand and gravel aquifers underlying cropland had high nitrate concentrations. Samples from 17 percent of shallow monitoring wells in this setting exceeded the Federal drinking-water standard. However, deeper wells (25 to 50 feet below the water table) in these unconfined aquifers typically had little or no detectable nitrate.

Researchers will: \r\n<p>\r\n<p>* Focus on abundance and diversity of plants and animals in young forests, seeking information on the best approaches to forest thinning for enhancing biodiversity or for minimizing impacts to plants and animals; \r\n<p>\r\n<p>* Study streamside or riparian areas, which are the transition zone between aquatic and upland habitats, to develop better methods for protecting these critical areas; and \r\n<p>\r\n<p>* Study species of special concern, including amphibians, lichens, fungi, mollusks and bats. \r\n<p>Ecosystem management is dictated by the Northwest Forest Plan, which was adopted in 1994 because of long-standing public concerns over management of federal forest lands in western Washington, Oregon and northern California. The plan provides a basis for regional-scale management of federal forest lands and attempts to simultaneously accommodate human needs, sustain critical ecosystem functions and maintain native biodiversity. \r\n<p>USGS, said Collopy, is committed to providing forest managers with new information to evaluate current and proposed forest ecosystem strategies and practices. The CFER research team consists of five scientists: W. Daniel Edge, Robert Gresswell, John Hayes, David Hibbs and John Tappeiner, whose disciplines include wildlife biology, aquatic and riparian ecology, and silviculture. \r\n<p>\"It&rsquo;s a team approach,\" says Oregon State University scientist John Hayes, \"because CFER&rsquo;s goals and objectives are integrated and interdisciplinary and require a broad range of experience.

The organic contaminants are known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH&rsquo;s). <!--introend-->\n<p>This link is inferred from analysis of surface sediment samples collected from different watersheds and from sediment cores in reservoirs. The samples were collected as part of the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. \r\n<p>These findings will be presented as part of the American Chemical Society Meeting, at the Dallas Convention Center on Tuesday, March 31 at 3 p.m., Room A215\/217, Level 2. \r\n<p>Rivers transport significant quantities of sediment seasonally, and reservoirs accumulate sediment over time, creating a partial chemical record of historical water quality. These sediment cores are laid down in distinct layers. They are comparable to tree rings in recording historical climate changes. Three reservoirs sampled in suburban areas of Dallas and San Antonio, Texas, and Washington, D.C., showed dramatic increases in PAH&rsquo;S with urbanization. These increases are occurring in spite of more stringent emissions controls and attempts to control urban runoff. \r\n<p>\"During the past 30 years, since passage of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts in the early 1970s, efforts have been made to reduce auto emissions and control pollutants in urban runoff,\" said Pete Van Metre, USGS hydrologist based in Austin, Texas and coordinator of the sediment coring project. \"These efforts have produced some promising results, for example, large reductions in lead in aquatic ecosystems and urban air. They have not, however, stopped all urban pollution.\" \r\n<p>PAH&rsquo;S&rsquo;s are an organic chemical class consisting of numerous individual compounds. They are universal products of combustion of natural fuels, such as wood or grass, and fossil fuels. They are also present in unburned coal or oil. Although ubiquitous in aquatic environments, they are typically not detectable in most water samples, but are bound up in sediment. Sediment-bound PAH&rsquo;S are not readily accessible to humans, although in some cases, fish or other lake-bottom organisms can be significantly exposed. \r\n<p>\"The concentrations of PAH&rsquo;S we observed in surface sediments collected from 20 river basins were, overall, below levels of concern for toxic or carcinogenic effects. We use PAH&rsquo;S as one of several indicator chemical classes for understanding the urbanization of watersheds,\" said Edward Furlong, Ph.D., a research chemist with the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory in Denver, Colo. \r\n<p>There are multiple sources of PAH&rsquo;S contamination to riverine sediments, including direct deposition from the atmosphere, PAH&rsquo;S-containing road runoff, and occasionally fuel spillage. These diffuse, nonpoint sources are likely the primary sources of PAH&rsquo;S to sediment and are difficult to control. PAH&rsquo;S&rsquo;s can also be produced in large quantities from point sources such as fuel refining, the conversion of coal to synthetic natural gas, and creosote plants. \r\n<p>\"We have no indication that the bulk of the PAH&rsquo;S measured in our study come from these point sources,\" Furlong said. \"The levels we typically observed are highest in highly populated urban environments, and the historical accumulation of PAH&rsquo;S in reservoirs appears to be closely linked to urbanization of the watershed.\" \r\n<p>The USGS NAWQA Program is designed to assess historical, current, and future water-quality conditions in representative river basins and aquifers nationwide.

Sandberg, geologist emeritus with the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver. \"The crater left by the ancient Nevada comet is now interpreted to have been at least one mile deep and 45 miles wide. It is comparable in size to one that struck the Chesapeake Bay area about 35 million years ago. On the basis of this comparison, the Nevada comet could have been as large as three miles in diameter, much larger than our initial calculation of one kilometer. It may have been part of the first of a series of comet showers that led to a mass extinction of many forms of life three million years later.\" \r\n<p>Startling new evidence provided by these conodonts on the depth of the crater produced by the Alamo Impact, 130 miles north of Las Vegas, will be presented at the North-Central Section meeting of the Geological Society of America in Columbus, Ohio on Friday, March 20, by Sandberg and his co-author Jared R. Morrow, USGS volunteer and instructor at the University of Colorado. \r\n<p>Conodonts are the microscopic teeth of primitive, boneless, eel-like animals. The shape of these animals is similar to that of modern hagfish, best known from the fjords of Norway. Conodont animals lived in many of the world&rsquo;s oceans from the Cambrian through Triassic Periods of geologic time (550 to 210 million years ago). The largest known conodont teeth, found near the town of Alamo in southern Nevada, measure nearly a half-inch in length, but most are not much larger than the head of a pin. \r\n<p>Evidence presented by Sandberg in October 1997 at the annual GSA meeting in Salt Lake City showed that impact-related phenomena, such as grains of shocked quartz and higher-than-usual levels of the element iridium, occupied a circular area at least 120 miles in diameter, but the size of the crater could not be determined then. Now, new conodont evidence for its dimensions has been found in small blocks of fallout debris from the impact crater. Iridium is an element found in asteroids and comets but not common on Earth. Shocked quartz grains are produced by the force of an impact on sandstone rocks. \r\n<p>This impact occurred during the Devonian Period of geologic time, 370 million years ago, when an ancestral Pacific Ocean covered most of Nevada. The impact occurred offshore from a carbonate platform, very much like the modern Australian Barrier Reef or the Bahamas Bank. Shock waves from the impact and ensuing tsunami waves crashed against the carbonate platform and coastline in a semicircular area 100 miles from north to south. As the carbonate platform collapsed, blocks of rock hundreds to thousands of feet across were torn from the seabed, twisted, and transported seaward. As tsunamis of decreasing intensity reverberated back and forth across the ocean basin, broken pieces of rock and other ejecta from the impact were deposited over the carbonate platform and high-water deposits were stranded in a semicircular band along the coastline to the east. \r\n<p>The small blocks of impact-fallout debris recently found within the breccia of large jagged blocks contain carbonate spherules formed from limestone fragments that recrystallized within a superheated cloud, shocked quartz grains, and bits and fragments of rocks blasted from the crater. Most importantly, they also contain conodonts ejected from rocks that lay a mile below the Devonian sea floor at the time of impact. \r\n<p>The timing of the Alamo Impact coincides with the demise of some Late Devonian reefs in Belgium and Germany and with unusual breccias in Germany and Austria.

Environmental conditions at the Sea have been declining for more than a decade. Because the Salton Sea has no natural outlet, salinity levels have become 25 percent saltier than ocean water, and the concentration of contaminants flowing into the Sea from industry, urban areas and agriculture have continued to increase. Recently, dramatic disease outbreaks in fish and birds have focused local and national attention on the Sea&rsquo;s degraded ecosystem.

Neither is there an \"earthquake deficit,\" according to Hanks and his USGS colleague Ross Stein. \n<p>The case for the \"huge earthquake\" was proposed by David Jackson, science director of the Southern California Earthquake Center in Pasadena. Jackson founded his argument for a huge earthquake on a perceived \"seismic moment deficit,\" meaning that the srain release that occurs during earthquakes has not kept up with the strain accumulation caused by the relative motions of the Pacific and North American plates across southern California. \r\n<p>Earlier reports of a deficit of magnitude-6 or larger earthquakes in southern California were in error, due to the incomplete reporting of earthquakes in the early part of the 20th century and before. This was due to the very sparse population and general absence of newspaper reports in the early years of development in southern California, Hanks said. \r\n<p>\"While the number of earthquakes in southern California can vary considerably over the years and decades, only rarely are these variations anything other than what might be expected from random processes,\" Hanks said. \"There have been no statistically significant variations in the number of 6 or larger earthquakes from one decade to the next in southern California during the 20th century, and there is no evidence that the rate of magnitude-6 earthquakes in southern California is increasing at the present time or at any other time during the 20th century,\" Hanks said in his presentation Wednesday.

Detection of deformation rate changes by several types of instruments, and the ability to evaluate alternative hypotheses for these changes have been two of the goals of the Parkfield experimental design. \r\n<p>Roeloffs and her USGS colleague, John Langbein say the rate of strain accumulation at Parkfield appears to have changed in 1993 from the essentially steady rate observed since 1985, when most instruments were installed. Since 1993, two 3-component borehole strainmeters, on opposite sides of the fault, are recording slower contraction and slower extension, respectively, according to Ross Gwyther and Michael Gladwin of CSIRO, Queensland, Australia, long-term collaborators at Parkfield. Three fault-crossing, near fault-parallel baselines measured using the two-color laser ElectronicDistance Meter (EDM) are lengthening or shortening more rapidly since early 1993. Faster relative slip is also indicated by creepmeters spanning the fault within the two-color EDM network. Roeloffs said the strainmeter, creep, and EDM data are all consistent with accelerated relative motion across a portion of the San Andreas fault, but the data cannot determine the location of the source area. \r\n<p>\"The acceleration of strain rate is small, 0.1 to 0.5 parts per billion per year,\" Roeloffs said, \"and can only be detected with years of data from sensitive instruments.\" The observations have been controversial because such slow changes in deformation rate could be affected by non-tectonic variations in precipitation and groundwater levels. Between 1991 and 1993, groundwater levels began to rise in response to increased annual rainfall. Roeloffs said soil moisture can destabilize surface monuments in the EDM and creepmeter networks, but that at least one creepmeter is recording accelerated fault slip since 1992 that is unrelated to rainfall. She said measurements in boreholes of crustal expansion and contraction are expected to vary with subsurface fluid pressure, but crustal shear measurements should be unaffected. Comparison of groundwater levels and shear strain records from Parkfield imply that the increased shear strain rates are not hydrologic in origin. \r\n<p>Few previous examples of deformation rates varying between earthquakes have been rigorously substantiated, because relatively few of the sensitive instruments that can detect them have been installed. A strain rate change before the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake was reported in 1991 by Dr. Gladwin and his colleagues, but the lack of other instrumentation makes it difficult to conclude that it was actual","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"890024400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Maps Show Where Earthquakes May Trigger Landslides in Southern California","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Earthquakes, as well as heavy rains, can cause landslides, but with the completion of a new U.S. Geological Survey mapping project, scientists and planners can see where those landslides might be triggered by southern California&rsquo;s next large earthquake. <!--introend-->\n<p>Speaking at the Seismological Society of America&rsquo;s annual meeting in Boulder, Colo., today (March 17), USGS scientist Randall Jibson described the new landslide maps and how they were developed. \r\n<p>Following the magnitude 6.7 earthquake that struck Northridge, Calif., Jan. 17, 1994, Jibson and his colleagues at the USGS used U.S. Air Force U2 photographs to locate the thousands of landslides that were triggered by that earthquake, and recorded the locations in a computer for later analysis. \r\n<p>The landslide-hazard maps were produced by combining several kinds of data. The strength of the rock and soil, the steepness of the slopes, and the ground-water conditions were combined in a slope-stability model to produce a map of seismic landslide susceptibility, which portrays how stable different slopes are during earthquake shaking. The susceptibility map was then combined with a map of predicted earthquake shaking to produce a model that predicts the probability of slope failure for those ground-shaking conditions. \r\n<p>It&rsquo;s this last step that is the key, according to Jibson. \"We&rsquo;ve always been able to say which slopes, in a broad sense, are more or less likely to fail during earthquakes,\" Jibson said, \"but this is the first time we have been able to say, specifically, how likely they are to fail. The ability to analyze a hypothetical future earthquake and to say that one slope has a one percent chance of failing during that earthquake, but another slope has a 25 percent chance of failing is a huge step forward. Now we can put real numbers on expected losses due to earthquake-triggered landslides.\" \r\n<p>One particularly powerful aspect of this hazard-mapping procedure is its flexibility. The data used to produce the maps are all computerized and they can be combined in various ways to suit a variety of purposes. For example, ground-shaking from any possible earthquake can be modeled, so that probable landslide concentrations can be predicted for any earthquake. \"Eventually, we hope to have this on an interactive web site where users can come in, specify an earthquake they are interested in, and download a custom map for their own uses,\" Jibson concluded. \r\n<p>Jibson said he expects the maps to be used for a wide variety of purposes, including seismic zoning, emergency response planning, placement of lifelines and siting of critical facilities. \"I can see many possible applications of this technology. One thing is certain, as development continues in earthquake-prone areas, the ability to predict where earthquake hazards are likely to occur will become an increasingly important activity. We want to give people the tools they need to make rational, informed decisions. If we know where the hazards are, we can prepare for them.\" \r\n<p>The landslide maps that Jibson and his colleagues have produced will be available in digital and paper form from the USGS Landslide Information Center in Golden, Colo., later this spring. \r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Editors: Interviews with Jibson during the SSA meeting may be arranged by calling the SSA news room at 303-492-2388, or his office in Golden, Colo., at 303-273-8577.<\/b><\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"890024400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Discovering Biological Diversity AAAS Topic for USGS Manager","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p><!--introstart-->Gladys Cotter, Assistant Chief Biologist for Information at the USGS, joins with Bonnie C.

The team&rsquo;s work on \"what&rsquo;s in a name\" was just awarded one of Vice President Al Gore&rsquo;s Hammer Awards for Reinventing Government. Roy McDiarmid of the USGS was also a leader of the interagency team. \r\n<p>ITIS, the Integrated Taxonomic Information System partnership, received the award for successfully completing a major reinvention project aimed at providing easy access to the first credible database of scientific names of organisms of North America and its adjacent waters. The system also provides information on the origin and general distribution of these biological species. \r\n<p>Vice President Gore&rsquo;s National Partnership for Reinventing Government identifies ITIS as a program that will contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of government and its partnerships by reducing the confusion and misinformation that are inevitable when people are unsure what each other is talking about -- or when they don&rsquo;t know that an animal or plant is known by several names. \r\n<p>The Vice President&rsquo;s Hammer Award is being given to the ITIS partner agencies for bringing ITIS from concept to reality. Six federal agencies worked together to foster and modernize the system for naming nature&rsquo;s living organisms: the U.S. Geological Survey, the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (including the National Marine Fisheries Service and the National Oceanographic Data Center), the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Agricultural Research Service and the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s National Museum of Natural History. \r\n<p>Each agency, said Waggoner, has a mission to inventory, monitor, research or manage biological resources. This creates a common need for a vocabulary shared through taxonomy, the science of describing, naming and classifying plants and animals. Taxonomic nomenclature provides the most fundamental building block for information sharing on biological resources: the scientific name. \r\n<p>ITIS, says Waggoner, is a grand new tool in the arsenal of environmental research, and for the first time is enabling the scientific community, resource managers, and the general public to have a common vocabulary of species at their fingertips in an online database.\"It is a deceptively simple notion,\" Waggoner said. \"All we&rsquo;re aiming for is a unified way of naming the \u00c3\u00abthings&rsquo; of nature.

In just two months last fall, more than 12,000 coots and dabbling ducks died at Shawano Lake; 1,400 died there the year before. \n<p>Cole identified the exotic parasite, Leyogonimus polyoon, in the carcasses of nine coots collected this year from the 6,000-acre Shawano Lake. Cole said that although the parasite was not detected during the 1996 die-off, she was able to find it in preserved samples from that event as well. Leyogonimus polyoon now shares responsibility for the Shawano Lake die-off with Sphaeridiotrema globulus, a trematode parasite previously linked to the waterfowl deaths. \r\n<p>Leyogonimus polyoon is a common killer of moorhens and coots in Eastern Europe, especially the Danube River area.

This is just under the average of 20 major earthquakes in the world each year. Despite the lower number of major earthquakes worldwide (21 major earthquakes were recorded in 1996), the death toll from earthquakes was much higher in 1997 than in the previous year. \n<p>\r\n<p>In 1996, a total of 449 people were reported killed by earthquakes around the world. More than double that number were reported killed in just the first three months of 1997. The total death toll from earthquakes in 1997 is at least 2,913. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The deadliest earthquake of the year struck northern Iran on May 10. Preliminary magnitude was 7.1. It caused at least 1,567 deaths, 2,300 injuries, and left 50,000 homeless. The strongest earthquake for the year in the US had a preliminary magnitude 4.9 and struck the State of Washington. It caused slight damage at Bremerton and Poulsbo. Other significant earthquakes for the year occurred near the East coast of Kamchatka, Russia; near the coast of central Chile; and in central Italy, causing damage to the Chapel of St. Francis of Assisi. A significant earthquake is one of magnitude 6.5 or higher or one of lesser magnitude that causes casualties or considerable damage. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The largest magnitude earthquake in the world in 1997 struck Xizang Province, Tibet, about 520 miles north-northeast of Kathmandu, Nepal, on November 8. Although the preliminary magnitude of this earthquake was 7.9, damage and casualty reports were light because the area is sparsely populated. Earthquakes are not unusual for this region; however, this event is believed to be the largest instrumentally recorded event in this area to date. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>We continue to hear from many people throughout the world that earthquakes are on the increase. Although it may seem that we are having more earthquakes, this is not the case. In fact, earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher have remained fairly constant throughout this century. \r\n<p>A partial explanation for this impression may lie in the fact that in the last twenty years, we have definitely had an increase in the number of earthquakes USGS has been able to locate each year. This is because of the tremendous increase in the number of seismograph stations in the world and the many improvements in global communications. This increase in the number of stations and the more timely receipt of data has allowed seismological centers to locate many small earthquakes which were undetected in earlier years, and we are able to locate earthquakes more rapidly. Also, because of the improvements in communications and the increased interest in natural disasters, the public now learns about more earthquakes. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Also, the effect that earthquakes have when they strike is generally more pronounced. Although we have gained much knowledge in building safer structures, when earthquakes occur today, losses (both human and property)are greater in many areas of the world. This is not because the earthquakes are stronger; it is simply because the Earth&rsquo;s population is increasing and more property (much of it not built to withstand earthquakes) exists that can be destroyed in an earthquake. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>USGS estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each year. Many of these earthquakes go undetected because they occur in remote areas or have very small magnitudes. The USGS locates 12,000 to 14,000 earthquakes each year (about 35 per day). \r\n<p>\r\n<p>Note to editors: Because of the nature of earthquake data collection, information on the above events should be considered preliminary.

The longest measured traveltime was about 50 years.\" Bachman said. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Even if tighter regulatory actions were able to eliminate the runoff of nitrate from the land surface, It will take decades for all of the nitrate to be flushed from the underground reservoirs or aquifers,\" the USGS spokesman said. <\/p>\r\n<p>Noting that previous research had shown that ground water was a significant water quality factor in some parts of the Bay watershed, Bachman said \"This is the first time that we have systematically examined the contribution of ground-water nitrate across the entire 64,000- square mile area of the watershed.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Nitrate is a nutrient, or plant fertilizer, and large amounts in streams contribute to algal blooms in estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay. As the algal blooms die and the algae decomposes, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water drop off to levels harmful to fish and other aquatic life. Nitrate enters ground water from nitrate dissolved in rainfall and snow, gases from motor vehicle emissions, lawn fertilizers, septic tank drain fields and the application of inorganic fertilizer and manure on farm fields. Ground water slowly flows through cracks and pore spaces in rock and sand reservoirs called \"aquifers\" before discharging to streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries. <\/p>\r\n<p>The study showed that ground-water discharge accounted for roughly half of the nitrate flowing into the Bay from non-tidal streams in the Bay&rsquo;s watershed. The study team based these figures on available stream-discharge measurements and chemical analyses of water samples collected between 1972 and 1992 by the USGS and other state and Federal agencies. Over 10,000 samples had been collected for chemical analyses at 127 sites. These data were used to compute the annual \"load\" of nitrate passing by each site, measured in tons of nitrate per year. <\/p>\r\n<p>Samples collected during periods of low river flow, or \"base flow,\" are thought to come primarily from the discharge of ground water. Nitrate loads computed from base-flow samples were then compared to nitrate loads computed from samples collected under all flow conditions. Base-flow and total-flow nitrate loads could be computed at 57 of the 127 stations. The percentage of base-flow nitrate load to total-flow nitrate load ranged from 26 to 100 percent with a median value of 56 percent. <\/p>\r\n<p>Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, and its 64,000-square-mile watershed is one of the largest in the world in relation to the size of the estuary. Nitrate contributions from such a large drainage area can have strong effects on marine life in the bay hundreds of miles from the source of the nitrate. The watershed contains a wide range of rock types and topographic settings, and it includes major metropolitan areas, such as Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, Va., and Harrisburg, Pa., as well as forests, wetlands, and some of the most intensely farmed areas in the Nation. <\/p>\r\n<p>The researcher","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maryland","Virginia","California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"881643600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169271"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Future energy source, greenhouse gas, drilling hazard ...

It has also caused frequent disruptions of electrical power, preyed on poultry, rabbits, and pets, and on occasion bitten infants when it invaded homes in search of food. <\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists estimate there are over one million brown tree snakes on Guam. Snakes can unwittingly be carried on ships and airplanes originating from or traveling through Guam. They can hide in cargo, airplane wheel-wells, and the vessels themselves. Snakes pose a serious threat to the wildlife and economy of Rota and other Pacific islands. <\/p>\r\n<p>Two arrivals of snakes have been recorded in Rota in the last ten years.No one can be sure how many went undetected. \"Female snakes may be able to store sperm, and therefore lay eggs, over a period of several years without further contact with a male,\" said Dr. Gad Perry, a primary spokesperson for the barrier project. Once a snake leaves the port of a snake-free island, it is almost impossible to catch. \"Every individual snake is potentially crucial,\" added Dr. Perry. <\/p>\r\n<p>The barrier, installed around the Rota port facility, was completed earlier this week. Rota is the only island in the world to have such a barrier. Scientists developed it for protecting large areas, such as ports and airports. It is made of metal mesh and attached to existing cyclone fencing. It will aid efforts by Commonwealth biologists to protect the island&rsquo;s interior from snakes. \"This is an innovative approach to risk-reduction,\" said Fritts. <\/p>\r\n<p>The project was built in coordination with the Mayor of Rota, Joseph S. Inos, and Rota Harbor Manager Fidel A. Mendiola. It was funded by two Interior Department units, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Office of Insular Affairs. <\/p>\r\n<p>There have been more than 40 reported sightings of snakes on Saipan, which has a much greater commerce with Guam. To date, seven brown tree snakes have been documented in the State of Hawaii. \"We are working on practical ways to protect islands from the problems caused by the snake,\" said Perry. \"This barrier will help capture any snakes transported to the port before they move out of the cargo area and become much more difficult to detect and capture,\" he added. <\/p>\r\n<p>Research leading to development of snake barriers was conducted by the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with Ohio State University. The Rota barrier now benefiting the Northern Mariana Islands, is a direct result of years of careful research on Guam. Development required thousands of careful observations of the behaviors of snakes, both in the field and in the laboratory. <\/p>\r\n<p>The scientists have developed three types of barriers. Mesh barriers of the type installed at the Rota port are more durable than the portable temporary barrier developed for military activities. Some exercises, such as this year&rsquo;s Tandem Thrust, involve moving large quantities of cargo staged on Guam to other sites, such as nearby Tinian. Snakes could hide in this cargo. <\/p>\r\n<p>A slightly modified version of a permanent snake barrier has recently been completed by Voice of America contractors on Tinian. It is now used to quarantine cargo arriving from Guam to ensure snakes are not introduced to the island during construction of a relay station there. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Ohio"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"878878800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169319"},{"tid":"169301"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"From Floods and Landslides to Ecosystems...USGS Scientists Gear Up for El Nino","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>From the West Coast to South Florida, the U.S. Geological Survey is gearing up as part of the scientific front line in studying and reducing the impact of El Nino. <\/p>\n<p>\"El Nino is a reminder of the importance of keeping our science guard up against real-time hazards.

Sliter, 62, was a resident of Palo Alto, and is survived by his wife, Trish Sliter, also an employee of the USGS. <\/p>\n<p>A memorial service for Sliter will be held at 7:30 p.m., Thursday, Nov. 6, 1997, in the Spangenburg Theatre of Henry M. Gunn High School, 780 Arastradero Road in Palo Alto. <\/p>\r\n<p>William Sliter was born May 7, 1935, in Los Angeles. He received a bachelor of arts degree in geology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958 and a Ph.D. in geology\/zoology, also from UCLA, in 1966. Following his graduate studies, Dr. Sliter worked briefly for the Humble Oil and Refining Company and then spent five years with Esso Production Research Company as a senior research geologist. Although his graduate studies involved Cretaceous foraminifers (microscopic clams) from southern California and northwestern Baja, his first projects examined Neogene to modern distributions of foraminifers and mollusks, as related to petroleum pollution. These studies resulted in reports and knowledge that would later compliment his studies of Cretaceous foraminifers. In 1972 Sliter joined the Canadian Geological Survey, in Calgary, where he continued research on Cretaceous foraminifers and Mesozoic biostratigraphy. While with the Canadian Survey he completed studies on the Sverdrup Basin and Vancouver Island. <\/p>\r\n<p>He returned to California in 1973 and joined the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s branch of paleontology and stratigraphy in Menlo Park, where he became part of Cretaceous studies on the West Coast and deep-sea drilling projects in the Atlantic Ocean. Through the later association he expanded his research interests into the Pacific Ocean. From 1978 to 1983 he served as chief for the USGS branch of paleontology and stratigraphy, at USGS headquarters in Reston, Va. <\/p>\r\n<p>He returned to Menlo Park in 1983 and returned to research, focusing his efforts on the Mesozoic terranes of western North America, which forced him to examine numerous limestones. The difficulties of working with these limestones served as a challenge, and in 1984 he published the first of several papers describing a Mesozoic chronostratigraphic zonation based on foraminifers in thin section. During that time he became a world authority on working with foraminifers in thin section and traveled extensively to teach the techniques he developed, and to lecture on the results of his studies on Mesozoic terranes, oceanography and chronostratigraphy. Throughout his career Sliter was actively involved in various geologic societies and organizations, including the Deep Sea Drilling Project, Ocean Drilling Program, the Geological Society of America, and the Cushman Foundation for Foraminiferal Research. He served as an editor, board member, president and vice president of the Cushman Foundation and co-convener and organizer of numerous symposiums, short courses, and field trips on foraminifers and Mesozoic stratigraphy. <\/p>\r\n<p>During his career with the USGS he served as a branch chief, as associate chief scientist of the geologic division, a member of the library advisory committee, the Western Region space committee, and as an administrator of the move of the marine geology team from buildings west of Palo Alto, to the main USGS campus in Menlo Park, earlier this year. <\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to his widow, Sliter is survived by two daughters, Susan Sliter of Santa Clara, and Diane (Mrs. Chris) Milenkovich, Sunnyvale.

Thompson of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a>, will present the potential regional-scale impacts of future climate change at GSA on Wednesday, October 22 at 10:30 a.m. in Room 151. These findings are based on a combination of global and regional climate models linked to other models that estimate the effects of climate change on vegetation and water resources. <\/p>\r\n<p>Thompson and his colleagues have employed the results of a National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) global future climate simulation to initialize a regional model with 60 km resolution. The latter model provides a more realistic view of the topography and regional-scale climatic processes than the global model. Output from the regional model was interpreted by models of hydrologic and vegetation change to simulate how the landscape and environment would be impacted on a 15km resolution under this \"greenhouse\" climate simulation. The simulated climate is warmer than today across the western United States, with the degree of warming varying across the region and with the seasons. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Under the simulated climate the northern Great Plains is 5\u00c2\u00b0 C warmer than today in the winter, but only 3\u00c2\u00b0 warmer in the summer,\" said Thompson. \"In contrast, the desert Southwest is modeled to be less than 2\u00c2\u00b0 C warmer than today in the winter, but as much as 5\u00c2\u00b0C warmer in the summer. Rainfall patterns vary even more on a regional basis, with the southern part of the region becoming generally drier than today, and the northern part wetter.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Global climate has varied greatly since the height of the last Ice Age 21,000 years ago. If current projections from numerical climate models are correct, then the Earth&rsquo;s climate may undergo similarly large changes in the next few centuries due to human-caused changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere, the so-called greenhouse effect. Most current climate models operate on a very coarse geographic and topographic scale, making it difficult to judge how the modeled future changes may impact society and the environment on a regional scale. This is especially true for temperate mountainous regions such as the western United States. The hierarchy of models employed by Thompson and his colleagues provides one means of exploring the potential impacts of climate change in such regions. <\/p>\r\n<p>Lakes and streams of the western United States would be strongly affected by the simulated regional changes in climate. As a result, the life cycles of many native fish species would be disrupted, and spawning might not be possible for some species. The potential ranges of plant species would also greatly change under the \"greenhouse\" climate scenario, and many important forest trees such as Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce could lose much of their modern geographic ranges. Other plants, such as the warmth and dry-loving Joshua Tree, could greatly expand their ranges under this scenario. However, not all possible future climates would necessarily have such strong environmental impacts. This strategy provides a means of assessing the impacts of a range of possible climatic changes on national lands and resources and may serve to identify processes and regions that are most vulnerable to these changes. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"877492800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Ancient, Tiny Fossils Contribute to Retrofit of San Francisco-Oakland Bridge","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>The presence of 125,000-year-old microfossils in the muds of San Francisco Bay may help engineers decide where and how to rebuild the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a>(USGS)scientist in Menlo Park, Calif. <\/p>\n<p>Mary McGann, a USGS geologist, and Doris Sloan, a geologist at the University of California, Berkeley, told fellow scientists that the presence of microfossils known as foraminifers at a depth of 200 feet beneath the present floor of the bay indicates that an estuary existed in the area approximately 120-125,000 years ago which had the same type of environment which has been present in the bay for the past 10,000 years.

Evidence of the widespread damage caused by this collision was announced October 20, 1997, at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Salt Lake City, Utah, by Charles A. Sandberg, geologist emeritus of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a>, Denver, and his collaborators, Jared R. Morrow, University of Colorado, and John E. Warme, Colorado School of Mines. <\/p>\n<p>\"The impact, which is named the Alamo Impact after the town about 90 miles north of Las Vegas, occurred offshore from a carbonate platform, very much like the modern Australian Barrier Reef or the Bahamas Bank,\" said Sandberg, who has been studying this area since 1991. <\/p>\r\n<p>At the time of impact during the Devonian geologic Period, also known as the age of sharks, an ancestral Pacific Ocean covered most of Nevada. Shock waves from the impact and an ensuing initial 1,000-foot-high tsunami wave caused extensive damage to the carbonate platform and coastline in a semi-circular area 100 miles from north to south and 35 miles across. As the carbonate platform collapsed, blocks hundreds to thousands of feet across were torn from the seabed, twisted, and transported seaward. As tsunamis of decreasing intensity reverberated back and forth across the ocean basin, broken pieces of rock and ejecta from the impact were deposited over the carbonate platform and high-water deposits were deposited in an bow-like curve along the coastline to the east. <\/p>\r\n<p>Three lines of evidence corroborate the extraterrestrial origin of the triggering mechanism for the unusual phenomena observed in 13 mountain ranges: shocked quartz grains, an iridium anomaly, and spherical carbonate ejecta. Shocked quartz grains are sand grains pervasively shattered by the force of an impact, iridium is a platinum-like element that is rare on Earth, and carbonate spherules are formed from limestone fragments that recrystallize within a superheated cloud. All three features have been recorded in association with other impacts elsewhere on Earth, such as the impacts that produced the extinction of the dinosaurs hundreds of millions of years later. The Alamo occurred about three million years before and may have led to an earlier extinction, one of the five great mass extinctions recorded in Earth&rsquo;s history, in Late Devonian time. <\/p>\r\n<p>Late-breaking field evidence suggests the existence of several channel deposits filled with broken rock debris in the deeper ocean basin west of the carbonate platform. Channel-fill deposits found at four localities show that the area of impact-related phenomena occupies a circular area at least 120 miles in diameter. Whether these deposits represent debris that flowed from the crater outward or slumped back into it has not yet been determined. However, plotting a point midway between these sites and the possible eastern crater rim at the west end of the Tempiute mountain range to the east suggests location of the impact site, now buried beneath a valley or much younger volcanic flows, north and west of the settlement of Rachel and about 130 miles northwest of Las Vegas. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Nevada"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"877320000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169489"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Scientists to ","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>What the rover really saw on Mars, the effects of an asteroid impact in southern Nevada 370 million years ago, and how climate change will affect society and the environment are a sample of the earth-science topics that will be presented by scientists from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> during a national science meeting in Salt Lake City next week. <\/p>\n<p>More than 100 USGS scientists will join an estimated 4,000 earth scientists from around the nation at the Salt Palace Convention Center in downtown Salt Lake City for the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America (GSA), Oct. 19-23. <\/p>\r\n<p>The meeting will get underway Sunday, Oct. 19, with several sessions devoted to the theme of this year&rsquo;s meeting, \"Global Connections.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>In subsequent sessions, Monday through Thursday, USGS scientists will present the following: What Sojourner Saw -- The images that the Mars rover, Sojourner, sent back from Mars show rocks and sand that resemble those in Utah, according to Henry Moore, of the USGS astrogeology team in Menlo Park, Calif.

He then spent the next six weeks at JPL, working with other scientists on the JPL\/NASA team to interpret the photos and other data that were being sent back by the Mars rover, \"Sojourner,\" as she slowly and cautiously moved across the boulder-strewn plain at the mouth of Ares Vallis. <\/p>\r\n<p>Moore always refers to Sojourner as \"she,\" noting that the little rover was named for Sojourner Truth, the freed black abolitionist of the last century who became famous for the messages she sent to slaves in the southern states. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"I see our Sojourner as a field geologist, says Moore, \"She gets out there and observes the landscape; takes samples, through her spectrometer; and sends back information to headquarters. Just what a good field geologist should do.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Like most Americans who grew up in the pre-space-travel era, Moore is still a bit in awe of the technological advances of the last two decades, and grateful that he is able to be part of that technology. <\/p>\r\n<p>Moore began his geologic career in 1954, after receiving a degree in mineralogy from the University of Utah. In 1960, while attending Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., he ran into Eugene Shoemaker, whom he had first met when both were working for the USGS in Grand Junction, Colo. Shoemaker convinced Moore to rejoin the USGS and become part of its fledgling astrogeology program. The rest, as they say, is history, as Shoemaker and Moore became advisors to NASA and helped train Apollo astronauts in \"crater geology,\" prior to the moon landings of the 1960s. When those astronauts brought back rock samples from the moon&rsquo;s surface, Moore was one of the scientists who helped in the analysis of those rocks and of photographs of the moon&rsquo;s surface taken from lunar orbit. <\/p>\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s experience in helping to select lunar landing sites and in astrogeology in general was transferred to the Mars Viking project, and he was among those who helped to select the landing site for the Viking that landed on Mars in 1976. <\/p>\r\n<p>Moore&rsquo;s retirement from the USGS in 1994 didn&rsquo;t mean that he cleaned out his desk and went fishing. Indeed, Moore puts in as many work hours now as when he was on the government payroll. The USGS has a policy of continuing to provide office space for scientists who continue to conduct research and publish their findings; both of which apply to Moore. Moore also spends much of his time traveling between his USGS office in Menlo Park, Calif., to the JPL offices in Pasadena, where he put in 12-hour days, seven days a week, in the weeks following the Pathfinder landing. \"It&rsquo;s so m","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Utah","California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"876974400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"The USGS presents: The Latest ","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>What the Mars rover \"said\" when she spun her wheels; what Iceland has in common with the Red Planet; and what \"bugs\" in rocks can tell us about ancient Mars are the topics of three presentations by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> scientists at next week&rsquo;s annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. This year&rsquo;s meeting will be held October 19-23, at the Salt Palace Convention Center in Salt Lake City. \n<p>A lot was learned about the \"dirt,\" or surface minerals of Mars by the way the Sojourner rover spun her wheels when she got stuck in the Martian sand, according to USGS emeritus, Henry J. Moore, who is a member of the NASA\/JPL team that has been receiving and interpreting data and images from the Pathfinder\/Sojourner since it landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. On Tuesday, Oct. 21, at 4 p.m., Moore will describe how, by measuring the torque of Sojourner&rsquo;s wheels, the angle of friction, and observing the Martian soil, he determined that some of the soils were fine-grained clayey silts, much like the rover would have encountered in many dry washes in the western U.S. \r\n<p>Moore also will describe the texture of \"Souflee,\" one of the first rocks the rover encountered, as well as \"Shark,\" a rock that Moore says strongly resembles the \"Wasatch conglomerate,\" a sedimentary rock layer that is common in northern Utah.

Many factors will challenge the survival of these migrants, one of which is disease. According to Dr. Lynn Creekmore, hundreds of thousands of waterfowl are presently dying from avian botulism in flyway staging sites in southern Canada and the northern U.S. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Creekmore is a wildlife disease biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emtc.nbs.gov\/nwhchome.html\">National Wildlife Health Center<\/a> in Madison, WI. It is her job to monitor the occurrence of wildlife disease events in the U.S. Dr. Creekmore points out that avian botulism is the most serious disease of waterfowl in North America and quite likely the world. <\/p>\r\n<p>The disease can produce massive annual mortality; during this year&rsquo;s fall migration, Canadian biologists are estimating the losses at one southern Saskatchewan lake to be as high as 300,000 to 500,000 birds. Also this year, at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, along the shores of the Great Salt Lake, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists report waterfowl mortality from botulism has reached nearly 100,000 birds. Most recently, approximately 5,600 birds are believed to have died from botulism at a National Wildlife Refuge in Illinois. What is even more troubling is that the mortality is continuing and may not end until cold weather drives the birds further south. <\/p>\r\n<p>Avian botulism is a disease of birds resulting from the ingestion of a paralyzing toxin produced by the bacterium, Clostridium botulinum type C. The toxin is closely related to botulism toxins A and B, which are responsible for a similar food-borne disease in humans. Affected birds lose coordination and show signs of paralysis of the legs and wings and labored breathing. In advanced stages of the disease, the birds cannot hold their heads up, and often drown or suffocate. <\/p>\r\n<p>Most outbreaks of type C botulism occur in ducks, and species such as pintails, shovelers, and mallards are among those that suffer the greatest losses. However, almost all birds are susceptible to the disease, says Dr. Creekmore, and in recent years, losses in other species, including pelicans, herons, and egrets have been increasing. Dr. Tonie Rocke, a veteran scientist also at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, who has spent years studying botulism explains, \"Often the disease will occur in one wetland and not occur in an adjacent wetland just a few yards away. If we could determine the environmental factors that trigger the disease, we may be able to devise wetland management methods to lower the risk of outbreaks and reduce mortality.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Rocke and her colleagues have made significant progress in determining the conditions that are associated with avian botulism outbreaks. The organism is widely distributed in wetland sediments and factors such as acidity (pH), salinity, and temperature apparently play major roles in increasing or decreasing the risk of outbreaks. The next step is to determine if management actions influence these key environmental conditions. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS National Wildlife Health Center is the foremost wildlife diagnostic and investigative facility of its type, devoted to identifying causes and possible management responses for episodes of death or debilitation among free-ranging wild creatures throughout the United States and, on a consulting basis, other nations.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"876369600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170250"},{"tid":"169012"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Chesapeake Bay Sediment: Home to Pfiesteria-Like Microbes","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Analysis of <a href=\"http:\/\/chesapeake.usgs.gov\/chesbay\/\">Chesapeake Bay <\/a>sediment cores collected by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">U.S. Geological Survey<\/a> and the University of Maryland Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies (CEES) indicates that some of the sediment samples dating back hundreds or thousands of years contain Pfiesteria-like organisms and other microbes. Pfiesteria are microscopic, single-celled plants known as dinoflagellates that have complicated life cycles involving many different physical forms. Scientists are aware that the Pfiesteria living in the sediments of the Chesapeake Bay watershed can become toxic and attack fish under certain, but not well known, nutrient conditions. <\/p>\n<p>USGS scientists have collected nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) data in the Chesapeake Bay watershed for many years.

Sediment cores taken from the bottom of the Bay and its tributaries allow scientists to \"look into the past\" by analyzing the fossil pollen, algae, protists, molluscs, crustacea, and fish from as long ago as 3,000 years.

The Department of the Interior reports that millions of dollars of damage are done annually to industrial, agricultural and municipal users. An annual average load of about 1.5 million tons of dissolved salts, largely derived from natural sources, is measured at a site on the Colorado River 65 miles downstream from Glenwood Springs. <\/p>\n<p>Over the past several million years, large areas of western Colorado near Glenwood Springs have collapsed over half a mile where ancient layers of sea salt have been dissolved and transported down the Colorado River, a process that continues today. Recent geologic mapping and historical hydrologic data, collected by a team of geologists and hydrologists from the Colorado Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey help explain the collapse. From these data, scientists estimate as much as 1,800 square miles in the Eagle-Glenwood Springs area of Colorado have been affected by collapse to some extent. As much as 550 cubic miles of the ancient sea salt have been dissolved and transported down the Colorado River during the last several million years. <\/p>\r\n<p>About 300 million years ago when the Ancestral Rocky Mountains began to rise, nearby inland seas slowly evaporated and deposited thick layers of halite (sodium chloride, or table salt) and gypsum (calcium sulfate) on the sea floor. These low-density evaporite minerals were subsequently buried beneath higher density sedimentary rocks. A vast, nearly-flat, basalt-covered plateau formed above the sedimentary rocks in western Colorado about 9 million years ago. Between that time and the present, this plateau rose to reach its present elevation of about 10,000 feet. As it rose, the Colorado River and its tributaries cut deep valleys into the plateau. The erosion of dense rocks that overlay the evaporites along the valleys provided the trigger that started a process of evaporite flow, dissolution,and collapse. Less dense halite and gypsum rose under the rivers to arch overlying rocks and allow evaporites beneath the adjacent mountains to flow laterally toward the river valleys and then upwards toward the top of the arches, causing widespread collapse on the flanks. Highly soluble halite and moderately soluble gypsum dissolve where exposed to fresh water, forming caverns that collapse, creating sinkholes under overlying rocks and soil. Groundwater transports the dissolved salts to the Colorado River to be carried downstream. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Detailed geologic mapping has helped us understand long term processes in the area that affect salinity in the Colorado River,\" said Vicki Cowart, State Geologist and Director of the Colorado Geological Survey. \"In addition, it allows us to delineate local geologic hazards such as sinkholes.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Sinkholes may be triggered under homes by something as benign as watering the lawn,\" said Robert Scott, project leader and USGS geologist. <\/p>\r\n<p>As a result, sinkholes affect the Glenwood Springs-Eagle area, potentially disrupting irrigation, and damaging buildings, roads, and water and gas lines. \r\n<p>These findings are also published in the Field Trip Guidebook on the Geology and Geologic Hazards of the Glenwood Springs Area, available through the Colorado Geological Survey, 303\/866-2611 <\/p>\r\n<p>A DETAILED SUMMARY OF THIS PROCESS, INCLUDING GRAPHICS IS AVAILABLE BY REQUEST.

Shoemaker Distinguished Achievement Award with the following citation. \"Gene Shoemaker had a prolific career, creating revolutionary scientific theories and communicating those theories and traditional scientific concepts through over 150 papers, Apollo Landing commentaries for CBS television, newspaper interviews, and public television documentaries. He set high standards for others to meet. Gene Shoemaker conveyed a remarkable enthusiasm and warmth when he was explaining scientific concepts to non-technical audiences. His joy in doing and communicating science attracted all that heard him to his field.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Receiving the award on behalf of Dr. Shoemaker was his widow, Carolyn Shoemaker, a planetary astronomer and USGS volunteer who collaborated with him on many of his scientific discoveries. <\/p>\r\n<p>The Shoemaker Communications Awards honor USGS scientific information products developed for non- technical audiences. Six awards were presented to the following products. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>A Topographic Field Trip of Washington D.C. (Interactive CD-ROM)<\/b>.

Scientists suspect a link between high nutrient levels in water and the occurrence of algal blooms and the occurrence of Pfiesteria-like organisms. <\/p>\n<p>Nutrients enter the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from \u00e2\u0080\u0098point&rsquo; and \u00e2\u0080\u0098non-point&rsquo; sources. Point sources of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen)are from wastewater treatment plants or industrial locations. Non-point sources of nutrients are more difficult to identify; they originate from agricultural, urban, suburban, or atmospheric sources. <\/p>\r\n<p>Nutrients enter the Chesapeake Bay from water that is washed off the land surface, chiefly in the aftermath of storms. Nutrients also seep into the ground water from the land surface and make their way into the rivers and streams that flow into the Bay, or directly into the Bay itself. <\/p>\r\n<p>Ground water is an important source of surface water and nutrients. The USGS has determined that about 50 percent of the water in streams comes from ground water, but the amount can be as low as 27 percent or as high as 85 percent. The amount of ground water varies according to the type of rock and sediment beneath the land surface. <\/p>\r\n<p><b>Up to one-half of the nitrogen entering the Bay travels through ground water. It is possible that about 10 to 20 percent of the phosphorus<\/b> entering the Chesapeake Bay also travels through ground water. (A key factor in understanding Chesapeake Bay nutrients is that half of the Bay&rsquo;s water comes from freshwater sources and the other half comes from the ocean.) Travel time of the ground water can be as short as one year or as long as 60 years. The average travel time is between 10 and 20 years. For this reason alone, nutrient levels in the Bay and any connection with fish health will continue to be a source of concern well into the future. <\/p>\r\n<p>For more information on the Chesapeake Bay and fish lesions, check the following World Wide Web pages on the Internet: <a href=\"http:\/\/chesapeake.usgs.gov\/chesbay\">http:\/\/chesapeake.usgs.gov\/chesbay<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/\">http:\/\/www.usgs.gov<\/a> <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maryland","Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"875246400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170308"},{"tid":"170024"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"A New View Of Alaska, USGS Presents Digital Elevation Map to Alaska Governor","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>A new, computer-generated, digital map of Alaska was presented to Gov.Tony Knowles and John Shively, Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, today by Gordon Nelson, State Representative for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). <\/p>\n<p>\"The first impression many people have of this map of Alaska is that it is a composite of satellite photographs, rather than a computer-generated rendering of digital elevation data,\" Nel son said during the presentation ceremony at the USGS&rsquo; Anchorage offices located on the Alaska Pacific University Campus. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"This new digital technique provides earth scientists with a new look at the fundamental features of Alaska.

The small fresh-water mussels have continued to impact industrial sites, water supplies, natural ecosystems and motorized boats from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, the scientists reported. <\/p>\n<p>Biologists have tracked the zebra mussel since 1988 when it was first detected in Lake St. Clair, a small lake in the Great Lakes chain. A new 1997 distribution map shows zebra mussels have spread to 19 states in less than 10 years. The USGS reports new locations in Lake Champlain on the New York-Vermont border and along the Ohio and Monongahela Rivers. Older populations in the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River continue to spread. And, biologists believe the population in the Tennessee River has yet to reach its peak. <\/p>\r\n<p>Native to Eastern Europe and Asia, zebra mussels have few natural enemies in the U.S. and their rapid reproduction has caused widespread economic and environmental damage. Concentrating at underwater sites where water flows rapidly, zebra mussels have clogged intake pipes of community water systems and power stations and have fouled the engine cooling systems of recreational boats, the USGS scientists said. In May, it was reported that a paper company had to remove 400 cubic yards of zebra mussels from its intake in Lake Michigan at a cost of $1.4 million. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS tracks and maps the spread of zebra mussels at its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfrcg.gov\/\">Florida Caribbean Science Center<\/a> in Gainesville. Updated information is made available to federal, state and local officials, universities and private industries. \"The zebra mussel invasion is of grave concern. Our scientists play an important role in helping develop a blueprint for those charged with fighting its spread,\" said USGS Chief Biologist Denny Fenn. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"The maps developed at Gainesville help focus our research programs by identifying vulnerable sites and conditions,\" Fenn said. Other USGS biological research centers are developing and testing a wide range of strategies to control the spread of the zebra mussel or minimize its impact, he said. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Zebra mussels are extraordinarily persistent,\" said Fenn. \"They are small, can attach themselves to a variety of surfaces and can survive several days out of water. In fact, live zebra mussels have been reported in California and Virginia where they were found attached to boats being trailered from the Great Lakes.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Scientists fear that recreational boaters may unknowingly spread the zebra mussel from infested rivers and lakes to previously unaffected waterways. \"That&rsquo;s why we are being so vigilant in our mapping and monitoring efforts,\" said Fenn. <\/p>\r\n<p>It is believed that zebra mussels entered the Great Lakes in the ballast water of commercial ships from abroad. As the ballast tanks were flushed, the mussels were inadvertently introduced to an environment where they could thrive without natural enemies to control their numbers. Their rapid distribution throughout the Great Lakes and major U.S. river systems is attributed to their ability to attach to boats and barges using these waterways. <\/p>\r\n<p>Zebra mussels were named for the striped pattern of their shells. On average, zebra mussels are less than an inch long, yet each filters about a quart of water per day to feed on algae. Zebra mussels attach themselves to hard or rocky surfaces, and will even attach to vegetation. Layers of zebra mussels several inches thick coat large areas of substrate in Lakes Erie and Ontario, USGS biologists reported, elevating concerns about the survival of remaining native mussels. <\/p>\r\n<p>The invaders attach themselves to the native mussel species,interfering with their feeding, growth, movement, reproduction and respiration.

The reef was unexpected, considering its depth at 60 - 100 ft, and location in the Gulf of Mexico. The discovery upsets conventional thinking that coral reefs are restricted to relatively shallow areas of the Florida Keys. \r\n<p>The reef has been overlooked in the past because it appears to be relatively flat on depth sounders and is too deep to be seen from the surface. The reef was previously known to only a handful of divers as \"Sherwood Forest\" because during early morning dives the corals were mysterious looking and reminiscent of a forest canopy. Although extensive coral bleaching caused by the El Nino effect, was visible, \"This far exceeds anything I have seen in the Florida Keys. It&rsquo;s a beautiful and healthy system,\" remarked Dr. Steve Walsh, U.S. Geological Survey biologist. \r\n<p>Low light conditions at these depths cause corals to grow in a unique flat plate-like form.

Several divers suffered from painful stings. Scientists speculate that the unique reef is very old and exists only because of the unique local conditions. Normally clear water allows sufficient light for coral growth and the depth of the reef apparently protects it from storms and extreme hot summer or cold winter surface waters in the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n<p>Scientists mapped and collected data on coral, sponge, and fish populations from many sites in the Dry Tortugas National Park and the western Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Participating researchers included scientists from the Biological Resources Division from the U.S. Geological Survey; the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA), the NOAA Corps; and the Florida Marine Research Institute of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. \r\n<p>\"The corals look like gigantic mushrooms gone wild,\" said Dr. Jim Bohnsack from the National Marine Fisheries Service in Miami, \"but the structural complexity of the reef made an ideal fish habitat.

The study, which was conducted by the USGS in cooperation with the town of Atherton, describes the general geohydrology of the San Francisquito Creek alluvial cone; historical ground-water development; present-day well distribution and ground-water use; the aerial and seasonal variation of ground-water levels and direction of flow; aerial variation in ground-water chemistry; and the establishment and initial measurements of a land-elevation surveying network for monitoring potential land-subsidence. \r\n<p>According to the report, ground-water pumping was estimated to be approximately 710 acre-feet per year, or nearly one-fifth of Atherton&rsquo;s total water supply. Water-levels during 1993-95 were above sea-level elevation, indicating that saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay was unlikely during this period. Water-quality data also suggest that saltwater intrusion is not currently a significant problem. \r\n<p>The study is an example of the numerous ways that the USGS cooperates with state, county and municipal governments, as well as other federal agencies to assess the quality and quantity of the Nation&rsquo;s surface and groundwater at more than 55,000 sites in the United States. \r\n<p>Copies of U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 97-4033, \"Ground-Water Development and the Effects on Ground-Water Levels and Water Quality in the Town of Atherton, San Mateo County, California,\" by Loren F.

Since 1980, volcanic activity worldwide has killed more than 29,000 people and forced more than 1 million people to flee from their homes. \r\n<p><!--introstart-->The United States, with 65 active volcanoes, ranks third in the world in the number of active volcanoes within its borders. \"Natural disasters, including volcanoes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, and other natural events, cost the Nation something like $50 billion dollars every year,\" USGS Director Gordon Eaton said. \"This economic cost is a terrible burden, a disaster tax if you will, that every citizen must pay. <!--introend--> \r\n<p>\"This is part of the national and international role of the USGS,\" said Eaton. \"To learn from past hazards, wherever they occur; to monitor what is happening right now in the United States; and to combine all that information and real-time data and make it part of the front-line defense that protects public safety and resources all across the country.\" \r\n<p>\"Volcanic eruptions have tremendous potential for destruction, but we are learning how to reduce the risk through research, planning, and public education,\" said Robert Tilling, chief of the USGS Volcano Hazards Team in Menlo Park, Calif. Starting at Mount St. Helens in 1980 and continuing to the present, USGS scientists have responded to dozens of volcano crises in the United States and elsewhere. \r\n<p>\"Hazards from eruptions are not limited to the immediate vicinity of the volcano,\" said Tom Murray, scientist-in-charge at the USGS <a href=\"http:\/\/vulcan.wr.usgs.gov\/\">Cascades Volcano Observatory<\/a> (CVO) in Vancouver, Wash. \"Huge debris avalanches and associated volcanic mudflows, like those at Mount St. Helens in 1980 or Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, can travel dozens of miles down the valleys around a volcano. In some cases, it may be safer to be closer to an erupting volcano and on high ground than it is to be farther away and on the floor of a valley.\" Officials at Mount Rainier National Park are considering (as of August 21) closing one of the park&rsquo;s overnight campgrounds because a recent USGS study showed that it is vulnerable to floods, landslides, and mudflows from the volcano. <a href=\"http:\/\/vulcan.wr.usgs.gov\/Volcanoes\/Rainier\/framework.html\">Mount Rainier<\/a> is considered by the USGS to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the United States, because of its history of eruptions and mudflows and the increasing population density near the volcano. \r\n<p>(more) Even more far-reaching than avalanches and mudflows are plumes of volcanic ash, shot high into the atmosphere, that can drift for hundreds to thousands of miles carried by upper level winds and can damage or even bring down an airliner far from an erupting volcano. This has become a serious problem in recent years as air traffic through some of the world&rsquo;s worst \"volcano shooting galleries\" has increased dramatically. \"A prime example is our own Aleutian volcanic chain in Alaska,\" said Terry Keith, scientist-in-charge at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avo.alaska.edu\/\">Alaska Volcano Observatory<\/a> (AVO), a facility jointly operated by the USGS, Fairbanks Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, and Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. \r\n<p>Every day, dozens of international flights pass over or near some of the Aleutians&rsquo; most active volcanoes.

Although printed maps are still in high demand, the need for computer-based geospatial data is increasing. Each year the USGS sells and distributes more than three million copies of more than 80,000 different maps to a wide range of users. During major natural disasters, for example, the USGS must be ready to print and supply maps needed by rescue and recovery teams. \r\n<p>Witmer joined the USGS in 1974 as a physical scientist, serving as the Geography Program coordinator responsible for supervision of geographic research projects and interactions with other Federal and state agencies.

To remedy this situation, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the California Office of Emergency Services (OES), the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG), Mono County, and the Town of Mammoth Lakes, has taken steps to simplify the terminology so that it more accurately reflects the concern over a given level of unrest, as well as the response of the USGS to the unrest. The proposed modifications were discussed at a recent meeting of the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (CEPEC). The town of Mammoth Lakes was represented at the meeting by the Mayor and two members of the town council. \n<p>The current notification system, which was implemented in 1991, involves six levels from N, which is normal or background activity; E-STATUS, weak unrest; D-STATUS, moderate unrest; C-STATUS, strong unrest; B-ALERT, intense unrest; and A-ALERT, when a volcanic eruption is likely within hours to days. This terminology was modeled after the scheme developed earlier for the Parkfield earthquake prediction experiment along the San Andreas fault in central California. This scheme had the advantage that it was already familiar within both the USGS and OES. It was designed to facilitate communication between scientists monitoring activity in the earth and civil authorities responsible for the safety of nearby population centers. \r\n<p>The weaknesses in the terminology used in this system became clear, however, after the news media began reporting the various \"status levels\" as activity fluctuated in Long Valley caldera, according to Dr. David Hill, the USGS chief scientist in charge of the Long Valley monitoring project. \"Phrases like \"E-STATUS\" or \"C-STATUS\" mean little to most people,\" Hill said, \"and in the absence of more compelling wording, the media often added the phrases \"volcano alert\" or \"volcano watch\" to complete the USGS statements, when in fact, we were a long way from a &rsquo;watch&rsquo; or &rsquo;alert&rsquo;.\" \r\n<p>Hill said the phrase \"strong unrest\" associated with a C-STATUS contributed to the confusion. \"A C-STATUS can be triggered by a magnitude-4 earthquake within or immediately adjacent to the caldera, while a magnitude-4 earthquake is traditionally described as a \"light earthquake\" by seismologists,\" Hill said. \"The phrase &rsquo;Strong unrest&rsquo; is also at odds with the statement &rsquo;activity at this level poses no immediate risk to the public&rsquo; that routinely accompanied status levels E through C. A common result was headlines and stories in the media that raised more public concern that was warranted by the actual level of the unrest in the caldera.\" \r\n<p>The newly adopted changes in terminology include combining status levels N through C into a single category, \"NO IMMEDIATE THREAT,\" that spans the range of unrest typical for the caldera following the swarm of four magnitude-6 earthquakes in May, 1980. This \"typical behavior\" has varied from a few earthquakes of magnitude 2 or less per day to occasional earthquake swarms that include a few magnitude-4 earthquakes. These swarms have typically occurred at intervals of months to years, and swarms of smaller earthquakes have occurred more frequently. Hill said this typical behavior includes gradual uplift of the resurgent dome at a rate that has averaged about one inch per year, and unrest at these levels poses no immediate risk to the public. \r\n<p>Hill and his associates at the USGS also recommend abandoning the letter-status (D-STATUS, etc) terminology in favor of more descriptive phrases accompanied by a color code.

The U.S. Board of Geographic Names is responsible for standardizing more than 2 million geographic names in the United States for use on Federal maps and publications. The interagency Board considers about 400 proposed new and revised names for geographic features that are submitted each year by citizens and organizations from across the country. The U.S. Geological Survey, as the Nation&rsquo;s largest civilian mapping agency, provides staff support for the domestic names work of the Board. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\"A map is about the last place you want to spell a name wrong or put the wrong name on the wrong feature\" said Roger Payne, Executive Secretary of the U.S. Board. \"There are a lot of good reasons to keep track of what we call our hills, rivers, and swamps and where they are,\" Payne said. \"Is the rescue pilot going to the right mountain, is the proposed name of the new town already in use, and is it Mount Venus or Venus Mountain?\" \r\n<p>\r\n<p>The newly generated excitement over the Pathfinder Mission and the geological features being discovered and named on Mars is sure to renew interest in naming celestial bodies and features. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<CENTER>You can visit the Geographic Names and USGS Mars mission home pages at: \r\n<p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mapping.usgs.gov\/www\/gnis\/\">http:\/\/mapping.usgs.gov\/www\/gnis\/<\/a>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>and \r\n<p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov\/USGSFlag\/Space\/nomen\/nomen.html\">http:\/\/wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov\/USGSFlag\/Space\/nomen\/nomen.html<\/a><\/p><\/CENTER>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"868939200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169472"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Potomac River Flow Well Above Average In June","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Potomac River flow near Washington, D.C., was well above normal in June <b>at 7.3 billion gallons per day <\/b>(bgd), one and one-half times the normal flow for this time of year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \n<p><b>June flow ranged from a high of 24.7 bgd (June 5) to a low of about 2.6 bgd (June 30).

Golf course officials have rerouted the sedonc hole in order to give the geologists a 10-day window for the study. \n<p>In a project headed up by Dr. David Schwartz of the U.S. Geological Survey and Dr. William Lettis, of Lettis and Associates, scientists from the USGS, the University of California at Berkeley, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company will study the soil layers in two 10-foot-deep trenches cut into the face of the northern segment of the Hayward fault. The golf course trenching is part of an effort to learn more about earthquakes that have occurred on that fault over the past 1,000 years. The project is part of an ongoing study by the USGS and other institutions to identify and evaluate earthquake hazards in the San Francisco Bay area. \r\n<p>During the 10 days the trenches are open the geologists will map offsets of exposed soil layers that have been disturbed in past earthquakes. They also will remove bits of organic material taken from those disturbed soils and have that material dated with Carbon-14 analysis, in order to establish the dates of past large earthquakes and the average recurence interval between those large earthquakes. Radiocarbon-dating results often take one to several months to complete, but because of the limited time-frame and importance of the dating, the radiocarbon laboratory at LLNL will have students at the trenches to carry the samples back to the lab for preparation and analysis. The first results are expected on July 12 and a second set of dates available on July 16. Rapid dating will help guide the study while the trenches are open. \r\n<p>In addition to carbon-14, the geologists will be analyzing the strata for pollen from non-native species of plants introduced into the area in the 1840s and 1850s. If present in the soils, this pollen could provide very tight constraints on the age of the youngest deposits affected by the fault. \r\n<p>The northern section of the Hayward fault, which stretches approximately 45 km (30 miles) from San Leandro, northward to San Pablo Bay, was estimated by the 1990 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities to have the highest probability (28% in 30 years) of producing the next magnitude (M)-7 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area. This calculation was based, Schwartz said, in part, on the assumption that the most recent large earthquake on this part of the fault occurred in 1836. A destructive M7 earthquake occurred on the southern segment of the Hayward fault in 1868. A new study of historical documents by the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG), however, concludes that the 1836 earthquake was not on the Hayward fault. If that is the case, it extends the minimum time since the last large northern Hayward earthquake to 220 years. \r\n<p>\"The elapsed time since the last large earthquake is one of the critical pieces of information necessary to evaluate earthquake probabilities,\" Schwartz said. \"The average recurrence interval for a M7 on the northern Hayward is presently estimated at 200-250 years, so if its been 220 years since the last one, you know where that puts us.\". The Hayward fault traverses a highly urbanized area, which presents unique problems for conducting earthquake geology research. Most of the northern Hayward fault is covered by roads, residences, commercial buildings, and\/or landslides. Less than five percent of the fault trace crosses undisturbed ground, severely limiting where data can be obtained. A preliminary analysis for this study using aerial photographs and mapping located only four remaining sites on the northern part fault that may provide well-constrained data on past movements.

The survey will focus on developing a better understanding of the rupture histories of the Seattle fault, the southern Whidbey Island fault, probable northwest-trending faults near Tacoma and Olympia, and newly discovered north-trending faults that may extend from Tacoma to Whidbey Island. \r\n<p>\"The histories of these faults have been difficult for geologists to define because of the region&rsquo;s thick cover of glacial sediment, abundant vegetation and major waterways,\" said Shawn Dadisman, one of the USGS scientists coordinating the project. \"With our high-resolution seismic profiling systems, we will should able to locate the extent of these faults and document the amount of recent shallow movement.\" \r\n<p>Dadisman said information on faults and fault histories in the Puget Lowland is a high priority for the USGS because the data are needed to develop useful and credible national and local seismic hazard maps. These hazard maps are widely used by planners and engineers to plan infrastructure, design safe buildings, and make decisions and recommendations for retrofitting older structures. The next set of USGS national hazard maps will be released in 1999. \r\n<p>The seismic survey, which will be conducted from the research vessel, the Robert Gray, will proceed north from Seattle to the southern Whidbey Island area, then south to Tacoma and Olympia, with detours into various Puget Sound waterways. A similar cruise conducted in 1995 covered the northern Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. \r\n<p>\"With the 1995 data we were able to show that the Seattle fault is moving at a rate of about one millimeter per year; about twice as fast as we previously thought,\" said Sam Johnson, another USGS coordinator of the project. \"We were also very surprised to learn that the Seattle fault does not form a continuous trace across Puget Sound, but has been broken up into segments by two potentially active north-trending strike-slip faults.\" \r\n<p>Johnson said the high-resolution seismic profiling systems used in the upcoming USGS investigation will focus exclusively on imaging the upper one kilometer of the subsurface, which contains \"critical evidence of recent shallow fault offset.\" The USGS and many collaborators will conduct a more extensive marine- and on-land seismic survey early next year to investigate the deep structure of regional faults in the Puget Lowland. \r\n<p>The equipment for the upcoming cruise will include a small compressed-air chamber that will be towed underwater behind the Robert Gray.

Digital recordings of the reflected waves will be computer processed by USGS specialists to produce graphic images of the sediment layers and the faults that have deformed them.

The flight patterns include the air space over the cities of Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, Olympia, Bellingham, Everett, Oak Harbor, Port Orchard, Bremerton and all neighboring communities. \r\n<p>The airplane will survey the area by flying back and forth along lines spaced one-quarter of a mile apart. The total distance of about 43,000 miles is equivalent in distance to about nine round trips between Seattle and New York City. The flights will be conducted during daylight hours, seven days a week. \r\n<p>The aerial survey is designed to remotely study geologic units that lie below the earth&rsquo;s surface, according to the project&rsquo;s chief scientists, USGS geophysicist, Richard Blakely, in Menlo Park, Calif. \"The airplane will carry an instrument that measures the magnetic field of the earth, which is related in part to the kinds of rocks that lie below the earth&rsquo;s surface.\" Blakely said similar surveys in other parts of the United States have proven useful for identifying faults that may pose earthquake hazards. Data collected from the surveys help to locate and characterize these faults in places where they are concealed by sediments, vegetation, water, and urban development. \r\n<p>The flights will be conducted by Sander Geophysics Limited, a Canadian company with a great deal of experience in conducting these kinds of investigations. The pilot and crew are specially trained for low-level flight, and anyone observing the aircraft should not be alarmed if they see it fly low or pass below the horizon. \r\n<p>The aircraft making the low-altitude flights over the Puget Lowlands will be either a Cessna 402B or a Britten-Norman Islander. In either case, it will have twin engines and be painted white with red and blue stripes. The geophysical instrument is located inside a \"stinger\" that extends from the tail of the aircraft. The airplane will emit no magnetic or electrical fields of its own, but will only measure the existing magnetic field of the earth. \r\n<p>The aerial survey is part of ongoing USGS investigations designed to map the sub-surface geology of areas of the United States where earthquakes or other natural hazards might occur. Similar studies have been conducted over the greater San Francisco Bay Area, including the site of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, over the Los Angeles basin, including the site of the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and over the Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area, including the site of the 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake. \r\n<p>The Puget Lowlands survey is being coordinated with geoscientists at the University of Washington and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. \r\n<p><b>Editors: For additional information or interviews with the scientists working on this project, call Richard J.

S. Geological Survey has released Open-File Report 97-59 entitled: Geology and Structure of the Pine River, Florida River, Carbon Junction, and Basin Creek Gas Seeps, La Plata County, Colorado. The results of the study reflect a collaborative effort between the USGS, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC), La Plata County, and four gas-producing companies operating in the northern part of the San Juan Basin in La Plata County, Colo. \n<p>Increased population growth in Durango and La Plata County has occurred at the same time as large-scale development of natural gas from Fruitland Formation coal beds. As a consequence, the public has become concerned about safety issues related to natural gas seeps where Fruitland coal beds crop out. The USGS was asked to study Fruitland coal beds in the seep areas at the surface and near the coal outcrops in the subsurface as part of a multifaceted study to evaluate the nature of the seeps. \r\n<p>\"The goal of the La Plata County study was to determine if man-made activities like drilling wells and producing natural gas near coal outcrops could be causing or contributing to the seepage of natural gas at coal outcrops in La Plata County, \" said James Fassett, geologist and USGS project team leader. \r\n<p>In the Pine River seep area, where the subsurface geologic data were most complete, geologic evidence indicated that the gas seeps were probably not related to the presence of nearby gas wells. In the Florida River, Carbon Junction and Basin Creek seep areas, subsurface geologic data were not detailed enough to warrant positive conclusions regarding the relations of the gas seeps to nearby producing gas wells. \r\n<p>A seep is defined as a place where fluids, such as water, petroleum, or natural gas emanate from the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Most seeps are natural, but in some unusual circumstances man-made activities can create new seeps or change the rate of flow of natural seeps. Because gas seeps can constitute a serious hazard, the BLM and COGCC were concerned about the source of the gas seeps. If nearby gas-producing wells were contributing to the seeps, these regulatory agencies would have to consider passing new regulations regarding proximity of gas wells to the outcrop, mandate mitigation measures, or in extreme cases, order the shutting-in of producing gas wells. \r\n<p>La Plata County officials required detailed geologic maps of outcropping coal beds in the major seep areas in order to precisely target possible hazardous areas where building development would have to be restricted. Gas-producing companies were concerned because they wanted to operate in an environmentally responsible manner and regulatory actions resulting in shut-in wells would be very costly. The companies wanted any such regulatory actions to be based on a totally objective scientific analysis of all available data. The USGS was selected to conduct the geologic study because of its long and well-established reputation for providing credible, reliable, and impartial Earth-science information to nearly 2,000 partners at the local, state, and regional level. \r\n<p>The report was prepared by USGS geologists J.E. Fassett, S.M. Condon, A.C.

The open-file report is divided into three chapters containing the results of the subsurface coal-bed correlation study, the results of the surface geologic mapping and joint measurement study, and the results of the deep-seismic study.

The SHIPS project involves a marine airgun survey of many of the waterways of Puget Sound and Georgia Strait, giving United States and Canadian scientists an unprecedented opportunity to investigate crustal earthquake problems in an urban setting. \r\n<p>During the SHIPS cruise, scheduled for March 1998, the Canadian research ship, Tully, and the University of Washington ship, Thomas Thompson, will record seismic reflection and refraction data from Olympia northward into Georgia Strait and then westward through the Straits of Juan de Fuca. \"There are few major urban areas where crustal faults can be studied with as much detail as in the Seattle area,\" noted USGS researcher Mike Fisher. \r\n<p>Although geologic evidence for past great earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest is clear, basic information about crustal earthquake processes is lacking. Recent research by the USGS and other organizations has shown that the Seattle area was rocked by a major earthquake about 1000 years ago. This earthquake, which scientists believe occurred on the Seattle fault, raised a beach on Bainbridge Island 22 feet, caused landslides in Lake Washington, and generated a tsunami in Puget Sound that surged northward to West Point and Whidbey Island. The main question for residents of the Seattle area is: How often do these major earthquakes occur? A major earthquake has a magnitude greater than magnitude 7. \r\n<p>\"Large earthquakes occur along the Pacific Coast because rocks under the Pacific Ocean west of Washington and southern British Columbia are thrust eastward beneath the North American continent, in a process called subduction,\" Fisher said. \"Two direct consequences of this relentless process are volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. As oceanic rocks move beneath the continent, shallow rocks shudder and lurch to accommodate earth forces that are deep seated and affect broad areas.\" \r\n<p>In this geologic environment earthquakes occur in three source zones: 1) the subduction interface, which is the contact between the bottom of the continent and the top of the downgoing oceanic rocks; 2) a deep zone beneath central Puget Sound where the downgoing oceanic rocks push beneath the North American continent; and 3) a shallow zone that includes faults just beneath urban areas. \r\n<p>Earthquakes generated along the Cascadia subduction interface can attain enormous magnitudes (8.5 to greater than 9) because this fault has a huge area. The last subduction-zone earthquake occurred on January 25, 1700. This earthquake generated a tsunami that has been dated by its arrival at several sites in Japan. In addition, precise dating of trees killed along the coast has shown that they died in the winter of 1699-1700. \r\n<p>The Puget Sound basin was hit a major earthquake in 1949 when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake occurred in the deep zone beneath Puget Sound. Eight people died as a result of the shaking from that earthquake. Other damaging earthquakes could occur along faults that are known to pass directly under urban areas. The Seattle fault, for example, threatens downtown Seattle and neighboring port facilities. Three other magnitude-7 earthquakes have struck the region of Puget Sound and Georgia Strait (Seattle and Tacoma in 1949, Vancouver Island in 1918 and 1946). All were similar in size to the January 15, 1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake, which demonstrated the vast destruction possible in a major urban area when an earthquake occurs on a shallow, crustal fault. \r\n<p>The degree of seismic hazard to the region of","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Washington"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"864705600","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Media Advisory: News Conference to Outline Earthquake Research Project","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the Canadian Geological Survey, the University of Washington, Oregon State University, the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria and the University of Texas, El Paso, will hold a news conference Thursday, May 29, 1997, to describe a seismic-imaging research project planned for the Puget Sound area in March 1998. \n<p>The news conference will begin at 1:30 p.m., in the auditorium of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) building at 7600 Sand Point Way NE, in Seattle. \r\n<p>A meeting with environmental groups and marine-mammal experts to discuss various aspects of the project will be held Friday, June 30, beginning at 9 a.m., also in the NOAA auditorium. \r\n<p>The news release entitled \"SCIENTISTS DESCRIBE UPCOMING EARTHQUAKE RESEARCH PROJECT SET FOR PUGET SOUND\" supplies background material on the SHIPS project.

These liquefaction features are formed by the shaking, shearing, compacting, pressurizing, and liquification of earth materials during seismic events of considerable magnitude. Geotechnical analyses of the liquefaction evidence has been critical for distinguishing various prehistoric earthquakes from one another and for estimating the magnitudes of these ancient quakes.

Smaller amounts of nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, and sediment in the river have led to improved water clarity so that more light penetrates through the water column. Research has shown that the availability of light is the primary factor controlling the resurgence of the SAV. Secondary climatic and environmental factors, such as the volume of water flowing in the river, sunlight, wind, and water and air temperatures, also affect the availability of light and SAV growth. Since SAV re-emerged in the tidal fresh water portion of the Potomac River in 1983, it has undergone a \"boom-and-bust cycle,\" which has propagated downstream. The amount of SAV coverage peaked in the upper tidal fresh portion in in 1986, in the lower tidal portion in 1991, and in the transition zone in 1992. In the lower estuary, SAV coverage continues to slowly but steadily increase. This behavior can be partly explained in terms of threshold light conditions and SAV habitat criteria satisfaction \"scores\" which the authors have developed. These observations strongly indicate that within-river water quality conditions have played the most significant role in this living resource change, although external forcing factors, such as global climate effects, do contribute.

Blakely described the gravity survey at the spring meeting of the Geological Society of America in Kona, Hawaii. \r\n<p>The Tri-Met tunnel being constructed by the Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon extends east-west, 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) through the Portland Hills and intersects several concealed faults that appear to be part of a system of faults that form the west margin of those hills. One of these faults, the Oatfield fault, was previously identified on geologic maps of the area and was confirmed by a USGS aeromagnetic survey several years ago. Three earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.0 or greater and numerous smaller earthquakes that have occurred near the tunnel in 1991 suggest that the Oatfield fault or other faults in the Portland Hills may be seismically active. \r\n<p>Blakely described how measurements of gravity can detect places where the density of the rocks changes from one point to another, as might happen where a fault has placed two different kinds of rock against one another. Gravity measurements were made at spacings ranging from 23 to 46 meters (75.5 to 151 feet) along the length of the tunnel, and the position and elevation at each gravity measurement was surveyed very precisely for later calculations. Because gravity measurements are not commonly made inside the earth, special data processing was required to account for the much larger gravity effects caused by the hills and valleys above the tunnel. \"When we do gravity surveys on the ground or from an airplane, we know that the rocks are always in one direction -- down,\" Blakely said. \"In the tunnel they&rsquo;re on all four sides, so it takes a lot of extra effort to interpret the data and map the rock units.\" \r\n<p>Blakely described the various gravity irregularities that were discovered in the survey.

Johnston, the USGS scientist who died when Mount St. Helens erupted violently on the morning of May 18, 1980. \n<p>Johnston was alone at the USGS monitoring post on Coldwater Ridge that Sunday morning, and when the mountain began to rumble, shortly after 8:30 a.m., it was Johnston who radioed to his colleagues in nearby Vancouver, Wash., \"Vancouver, Vancouver, this is it!\" \r\n<p>Johnston was killed by the force of the 200-mile-per-hour blast of heat and gas that blew out of the side of the mountain. His body was never found. \r\n<p>David Johnston was born in Chicago on Dec. 18, 1949, and grew up in the Chicago suburb of Oak Lawn. At the time of his death he had been employed by the USGS for nine years, having joined the agency in 1971, the same year that he graduated in geology \"with highest honors,\" from the University of Illinois. He worked for the USGS in conjunction with his post-graduate studies at the University of Washington, where he received his Ph.D in 1978. \r\n<p>Although his geologic career spanned less than a decade and much of it was dedicated to his academic studies, he had already received international recognition for his studies of St. Augustine and Katmai volcanoes in Alaska, as well as volcanic studies of the San Juan mountains in Colorado, and geothermal studies of the Azores. He published 13 scientific papers between 1976 and 1980. \r\n<p>Johnston went to Mount St. Helens in late March 1980, when the mountain first stirred to life by emitting steam and ash. He helped to install the seismic monitoring network that allowed scientists to record the numerous small earthquakes that occurred as lava and gasses travelled toward the surface of the mountain during April and early May. He also helped to gather water samples from a small lake in the volcano&rsquo;s old crater, and performed tests on those samples that showed that dactite magma, a slow-flowing lava, was moving through the innards of the mountain. \r\n<p>Although he could be fun and horse around a bit, most of Johnston&rsquo;s USGS colleagues remember him as a quiet, serious, young man, totally unlike the hot-headed daredevil depicted in the post-eruption movie, \"St. Helens.\" \r\n<p>Seventeen years after his death, fellow scientists who worked with Johnston at Mount St. Helens and on other field assignments have no doubt that he would have had a very successful career with the USGS and today would probably be in some senior position in the agency&rsquo;s volcanoes research program. \r\n<p>\"He was a good scientist and a good team player,\" said Tom Casadevall. \"He was organized and focused and a good manager of his own projects, and would have been able to transfer those skills to the management of larger projects.\" Casadevall, who is two years older than Johnston and who worked with him in Colorado, Hawaii and Mount St. Helens, is an expert in the mechanics of the disbursement of volcanic ash. He has risen through the management ranks of the USGS and is currently the regional director of the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif. Peter Lipman, who was Johnston&rsquo;s mentor during his doctoral studies, shares Casadevall&rsquo;s appraisal of the career that might have been Johnston&rsquo;s. \"He was good scientist, and perhaps would have become a great scientist,\" Lipman said. \"He just wasn&rsquo;t as lucky as the rest of us.\" \r\n<p>In addition to the new observatory on Coldwater Ridge, the USGS has already honored Johnston by naming the building that houses the agency&rsquo;s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., the \"David A.

For information on filming and interviews, please contact: Gregg Wiche or Russ Harkness, USGS, Bismarck, N.Dak., 701-250-4601.) \n<p>\r\n<p>As the unprecedented floodwaters of the Red River slowly begin to subside in Grand Forks, N. Dak., crews from the U.S. Geological Survey are tracking the northward movement of the water, taking measurements to help improve forecasts of the flood for evacuations upstream. \r\n<p>Records of the flood flows are also vital to engineers and planners who need the information to design safe and effective future flood-control levees, reservoirs and bridges in the area. \r\n<p>Crucial to the understanding of the impact of the flood on upstream communities will be how much water is contributed by the Pembina River, which is the last major tributary into the Red before it enters Canada. Flow of the Pembina River at Neche, North Dak., on April 24, where the USGS maintains a streamflow gaging station, was 10,200 cubic feet per second (cfs) or 6.6 billion gallons per day (bgd) and the gage height is steady due to backwater from the Red River of the North. On April 22, the USGS crews had measured 11,800 cfs (7.6 bgd), which exceeded the previous peak record of 10,700 cfs (6.9 bgd) in 1950. \r\n<p>The USGS North Dakota office has been joined by USGS hydrologic monitoring crews from nine states to keep all phases of the field operation going. Specially trained crews from the USGS water resources office in Kentucky are helping North Dakota crews to install a temporary streamflow gaging station on the Red River at Pembina and will be taking additional measurements using Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler equipment. This sophisticated technology allows hydrologists to measure the velocity of water by bouncing sound waves off of suspended sediments and debris in the river, and then comparing the shift in the frequency of the echoed sound. \r\n<p>The echoed sound -- the Doppler shift -- is not unlike the change in emitted or reflected sound from a car passing a stationary observer; that is, higher in frequency or pitch as the car approaches the observer and lower as the car moves away. In the case of the Accoustic Doppler Current Profiler, sensitive electronic instruments detect the shift in the sound, which is directly proportional to the relative speed of the water and water-borne sediments as the water moves closer to or away from the ADCP. \r\n<p>ADCP discharge or volume measurements are typically made from a boat from which the equipment is suspended in the water. The boat passes across the river while scientists record river velocity and depth using the ADCP. Such measurements are particularly helpful in a flood situation such as that on the Red River because it enables hydrologists to take measurements in the river instead of from stationary points on bridges that are inundated and inaccessible.

Although the 132 USGS employees that occupy offices in Placer Hall are all associated with the agency&rsquo;s water-resources division, the various scientific disciplines of the USGS have played a vital role in adding to knowledge of the mineral, water and biological resources of the Golden State for more than a century. \n<p>Even before there was a USGS, the federal government was conducting topographical and geological surveys of the Sierra Nevada. Following the discovery of gold at Sutter&rsquo;s Fort in 1848, President Polk recommended annexation of the territory and advocated a \"mineralogical examination to preserve the mineral lands for the use of the United States, so as to secure a large return of money to the treasury, and at the same time lead to the development of their wealth by individual proprietors and purchasers.\" \r\n<p>Clarence King, for whom King&rsquo;s Canyon National Park is named, began his scientific career by mapping the Yosemite Valley for the state of California, in 1864. Three years later he was named \"United States Geologist\" in charge of the geological exploration of the 40th parallel, and in 1870 King discovered and mapped a glacier on the northwest side of Mount Shasta; the first actual glacier ever discovered in the United States. King&rsquo;s reputation, based primarily on his work in California grew, and in 1879 he was appointed the first director of the newly chartered U.S. Geological Survey. \r\n<p>Although it was gold that brought early settlers to California, it was water, and the ability to control its flow, both for mining and for farming, that convinced them stay. William Hall, who served as state engineer in the early days of California statehood, was selected by the USGS&rsquo;s second director, John Wesley Powell, to head up the agency&rsquo;s \"Hydraulic and Hydrographic Branch,\" also know as the \"Irrigation Survey,\" in 1890. \r\n<p>Hall&rsquo;s selection for the USGS position was based on his successful establishment of 12 gauging stations on the San Joaquin River in 1878, and his development of a method of plotting mean-velocity of flows and area curves to more accurately measure water volume in shifting river channels. \r\n<p>Under Hall&rsquo;s leadership in the USGS hydrographic branch, more gauging stations were established on rivers throughout the state, and in 1897, in one of its first cooperative ventures, USGS engineers conducted a \"reservoir and irrigation investigation,\" for the city of San Francisco, that resulted in selection of the Hetch Hetchy valley for the city&rsquo;s main reservoir storage site. \r\n<p>Because topographic mapping was essential to nearly all earth-science research projects, the USGS \"Topographic Corps\" played a major role in the agency&rsquo;s early work in California. Also, because the state&rsquo;s generally mild climate allowed outdoor work, year &rsquo;round, California was a popular field assignment for USGS surveyors and cartographers. \r\n<p>In its early years the USGS had no formal branch of earthquake studies, but one of its most prominent geologists, G.K. Gilbert, just happened to be in Berkeley when the devastating earthquake hit San Francisco on April 18, 1906. Within days he and another USGS geologist were part of the state&rsquo;s official \"Earthquake Investigations Commission.\" Although it would be many years before the USGS had a \"branch of seismology,\" structural mapping of the San Andreas fault began in 1921, as part of a government program aimed at \"predicting major earthquakes and devising practical measures to mitigate the disaster caused by their destructive shocks.\" The USGS conducts many seismic and earthquake-r","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"861076800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"MEDIA ADVISORY: USGS Director to Speak at Sac State","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Dr. Gordon Eaton, the national director of the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., will be one of the speakers at the Friday, April 18, 1997 dedication of Placer Hall on the California State University at Sacramento campus. \n<p>The new building will house offices and laboratories of the USGS division of water resources, as well as CSUS Department of Geology offices and classrooms. \r\n<p>Dr. Eaton will be available for news media interviews between 2 and 3 p.m., and immediately following the 4 p.m. dedication ceremony. \r\n<p>The attached news releases offer background material on the new facility and on the history of the USGS in California. \r\n<p>For additional information, call the USGS Public Affairs Office in Menlo Park, at 415-329-4000, or the USGS Water Resources Office in Sacramento at 916-278-3026. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["California"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"861076800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Low Levels of Gasoline Additive in Urban Stormwater and Ground Water a Key Topic at Chemical Society Meeting in San Francisco","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>(Note to Editors: Reporters are encouraged to attend the paper presentations and view the poster sessions on MTBE at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco, Calif., April 13-17, 1997, at the San Francisco Marriott, 55 Fourth St. ACS will hold a media advisory on MTBE on Wed., April 16, at 12:30 p.m. in Pacific Suite C.

U.S. Geological Survey scientists will report on several studies of the occurrence and distribution of this compound in surface water and ground water during the session. \r\n<p>MTBE, derived from natural gas, is added to gasoline in many parts of the United States to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone levels in the air (95% of total MTBE use), or to increase the octane of gasoline (5% of use). MTBE is the most widely used oxygenate for these purposes, however, ethanol is used in many areas of the Nation. Oxygenates, such as MTBE and ethanol, reduce the need for benzene and other ozone-forming aromatic compounds in gasoline. \r\n<p>MTBE, and other ether oxygenates, are some of the 88 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are being measured by the USGS in 1997 in surface water and ground water throughout the United States as part of the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program. MTBE was included in the list of compounds measured because of its: (a) widespread use as an oxygenate, (b) potential release, past and present, from storage tanks and other point sources, (c) detection in shallow ground water in urban areas, and (d) impact to some drinking-water wells. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has classified MTBE as a possible human carcinogen and has established a draft lifetime drinking-water advisory of 20-200 ug\/L (micrograms per liter). This advisory is currently being updated. Also, MTBE imparts taste and odor to water, which can be detected by many persons beginning at levels between 40-130 ug\/L.

Ninety-seven percent of the MTBE detections were found in Connecticut and Massachusetts, where reformulated gasoline that often contains MTBE is used year round. MTBE was present in 26 of 103 (25%) monitoring wells screened in near-surface aquifers and in 7 of 30 (23%) water-supply wells in fractured bedrock. Most MTBE detections were in areas where the human population exceeds 1,000 residents per square mile. Concentrations of MTBE were low and suggest that nonpoint sources such as atmospheric deposition and recharge of urban runoff are the likely sources of MTBE in ground water.

Although concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in samples collected from heavily populated and urbanized areas, MTBE was detected in all types of land-use settings. Concentrations, however, are generally low and rarely exceed the draft lifetime health advisory. MTBE was detected more frequently in surface-water samples collected during winter months than in summer months. Low median concentrations in both streams and ground water, and increased detection frequencies in streams during winter months, indicate that nonpoint sources of contamination such as precipitation or stormwater runoff may play important roles in the frequent low-level detection of MTBE. Point sources of contamination may augment nonpoint sources in more highly urbanized areas resulting in more frequent detections and larger concentrations.

Catchings described the numerous unknown factors related to blind thrust faults in the Los Angeles region at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America (SSA), at the Hawaiian Regent Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii. \n<p>Catchings said the January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred on a type of fault known as a \"blind thrust.\" The term \"blind thrust\" is used for thrust faults that do not breach the ground surface. The blind thrust fault that produced the Northridge earthquake extends toward the earth&rsquo;s surface about 35 km (~20 miles) northwest of Los Angeles in the Santa Susanna Mountains, near the town of Newhall. \r\n<p>One of four areas where major surface cracking was observed following the 1994 earthquake was west of Newhall in an area known as Potrero Canyon. Because Potrero Canyon experienced major surface cracking during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and because it is located near the surface projection of the Northridge fault, USGS scientists conducted a series of investigations in Potrero Canyon starting in January 1994, shortly following the Northridge earthquake. The investigations included a seismic survey to visualize the possible near-surface extension of the Northridge fault or other faults. \r\n<p>Seismic reflection images from Potrero Canyon show evidence of at least one thrust fault at depths as shallow as 500 meters and show evidence of other faults beneath Potrero Canyon that project to the near-surface. Movement on any or a combination of these faults may have caused increased shaking in Potrero Canyon, resulting in the observed surface cracking. \r\n<p>Without a more detailed seismic investigation, Catchings said, USGS scientists do not know if any of the faults imaged are an extension of the fault that caused the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but the primary thrust fault imaged in the seismic survey does project to the southeast toward the 1994 Northridge earthquake&rsquo;s hypocenter. more--SSA-97-Catchings 2--SSA-97-Catchings \r\n<p>Together with scientists from Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), the USGS scientists currently have plans to conduct seismic imaging investigations in an area closer to the epicenter of the Northridge earthquake. \r\n<p>\"Regardless of whether or not the fault imaged is an extension of the Northridge fault, the seismic image obtained is important because (1) it shows thrust faults beneath an area undergoing rapid suburban grow, and (2) it shows that these faults can be replicated and located in the greater Los Angeles area.

A hazard that might not come to mind is the possibility of earthquakes, as large as magnitude-eight, under the flanks of the active volcanoes, according to Fred Klein, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. \n<p>\"The earthquake shaking hazard in some areas of Hawaii is comparable to that near the major faults of California, Klein said Wednesday, April 9, at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America (SSA), in Honolulu. \r\n<p>Klein demonstrated how large Hawaiian earthquakes occur as the flanks of volcanoes are pushed sideways by a growing rift zone, and the six-mile-thick flank slips on its base, causing an earthquake. \"The force can be demonstrated by pushing a brick sideways as it rests on a rough table; your hand is the rift zone, the brick is the flank, and its sudden slip is the earthquake.\" \r\n<p>The largest earthquake hazard in Hawaii, according to Klein, is on the south and west mobile flanks of Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes. In south Hawaii the average recurrence intervals, or times between earthquakes, are 29-44 years for a magnitude-7 or larger, and 120-190 years for a magnitude-8 or larger. The largest earthquakes in Hawaii&rsquo;s recorded history were the April 2, 1868 magnitude-7.9; and the November 29, 1975, magnitude-7.2 earthquakes. In the Kona and Hualalai areas of west Hawaii, the average recurrence intervals for magnitude-5.5 earthquakes is 3-10 years and 265-300 years for magnitude-7 events. The largest historic Kona earthquake was a magnitude-6.9, on August, 21, 1951. \r\n<p>Klein presented a new map that delineates the amount of \"probabilistic ground shaking,\" (PGA) where the calculated shaking has a 10 percent chance of occurring during a 50 year period. The degree of shaking is not only useful for identifying the hazardous zones, but also for telling engineers how much shaking buildings may receive. \"The probabilistic 0.5 g (half the force of gravity) peak shaking calculated for Hilo means that a building designed to withstand 0.5 g has only a 10% chance of being damaged in a 50 year period by an earthquake anywhere on the island,\" Klein said. \r\n<p>Klein said Hawaiian PGAs at lava sites are calculated from a relation where shaking increases with magnitude and decreases with distance. Amplification of sites on volcanic ash or unconsolidated soil are about two times those of hard lava sites. \r\n<p>On a map for a 50-year exposure time with a 90 percent probability of not being exceeded, the PGA is 1.0-1.3 g on Kilauea&rsquo;s and Mauna Loa&rsquo;s mobile south flanks; 0.7 g in the central Kona area of Mauna Loa&rsquo;s west flank; and 0.3 g at the north tip of the island. Klein said the new seismic hazard map supports an argument to raise Hawaii Island from the Universal Building Code&rsquo;s seismic zone three, to zone four. Zone four is presently the highest level of hazard zone, and is assigned to much of California. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Editors: Dr. Klein may be contacted for interviews by calling the SSA newsroom at the Hawaiian Regent Hotel in Honolulu, at 808-921-5036.<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Hawaii"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"860472000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Public Invited to Tour New Science Building at U of A","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Following the official dedication Friday morning, March 21, 1997, of the University of Arizona&rsquo;s new Environment and Natural Resources Building, the public is invited to tour the facility on the campus at the northeast corner of Sixth Street and Park Avenue. \n<p>The two federal agencies that occupy the building, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service, will host public tours of the three-story facility from noon to 6 p.m. Those who wish to attend are advised to come to the central atrium on the ground floor, and follow the \"open house\" guide signs.

Smith, a U of A professor of irrigation engineering, established a gauging station on the Santa Cruz River near Tucson in 1905, and furnished the records to the USGS. \r\n<p>Even before there was a USGS, and when most of Arizona was still an unmapped territory, Major John Wesley Powell, who is generally regarded as the \"father of the USGS,\" wrote of the geological wonders of the American southwest, when he became the first person known to have successfully rafted the course of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, in 1869. During subsequent journeys of exploration, Powell and others who would become part of the USGS after its founding in 1879, investigated the many aspects of this land of red rocks, deep chasms and high deserts. \r\n<p>In addition to producing reports and maps on the surface and subsurface of the land and its waterways, Powell began a disciplined study of Native Americans; a study that evolved into the Bureau of Ethnology, the forerunner of the Department of the Interior&rsquo;s Bureau of Indian Affairs. \r\n<p>Powell realized early on that in the western states, water, or the lack of it, was the most important component in future development. It was under his USGS directorship that the Survey&rsquo;s \"division of hydrography\" was established in 1889, and stream-flow gauging stations, as well as ground-water monitoring sites were established throughout the western states. \r\n<p>Arizona&rsquo;s rich mineral resources were the subject of many early USGS field expeditions and publications that were designed to make mineral-resource information to mining companies and the general public. The increased demands for minerals created by World War I and the even greater demands of World War II and the post-war atomic age further increased the USGS presence in Arizona. \r\n<p>As America entered the space age, the USGS created its branch of astrogeophysics and celestial mapping, and centered much of that research in its field office on the University of Northern Arizona campus in Flagstaff. \r\n<p>That USGS branch&rsquo;s first chief scientist, Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, worked with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to determine the site for the 1969 Apollo Moon landing. During the next 25 years USGS astrogeologists at Flagstaff would map the surface and subsurface of Mars and Venus, and in association with Arizona&rsquo;s Lowell Observatory, Shoemaker and his wife, Carolyn, would discover and map the orbits of 30 meteorites and asteroids, including the Shoemaker-Levy comet that collided with the surface of Jupiter in 1995. \r\n<p>USGS water-resources and geologic investigations in Arizona, which began with Powell&rsquo;s exploration of the Grand Canyon, expanded through the years to include today&rsquo;s 239 gauging stations. The USGS also played a vital role in pre- and post-flood observations of the Colorado River, attendant to the 1996 controlled flood from Glen Canyon Dam. \r\n<p>In addition to pursuing its own scientific programs in Arizona throughout the past century, the USGS has worked closely with the state government to establish and support topographical, geological and hydrological research in Arizona. The Arizona Bureau of Mines was established within the framework of the University of Arizona, and with the assistance of the USGS, in 1915, and in 1924 the USGS \"loaned\" the services of Dr. D.H.

The conference, sponsored by the Association of State Wetland Managers, runs through March 13, 1997, at the Wyndham Garden Hotel. USGS scientists worked with colleagues from state and other federal agencies and the academic community to provide this first-ever, state-by-state look at the nation&rsquo;s vital wetland resources, including the type and distribution of wetlands, trends on wetland gains and losses, and conservation efforts in each state. \r\n<p>\"The 103 million acres of wetlands remaining in the United States are not only a source of critical habitat for waterfowl, but they also reduce the severity of floods and erosion by modifying the flow of water and improve water quality by filtering out contaminants,\" said Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, in commenting on the report. \r\n<p>\"I am particularly pleased with the strong cooperation between the USGS and the former National Biological Service in bringing the many facets of wetland resources together and producing this landmark report.

Although the rate of wetland conversion has slowed in recent years, wetland losses continue to outdistance wetland gains. \r\n<p>Wetlands associated with lakes and streams store floodwaters by spreading water out over a large flat area. This temporary storage of water decreases runoff velocity, reduces flood peaks and distributes stormflows over longer time periods, causing tributary and main channels to peak at different times. \r\n<p>Watersheds with more wetlands tend to have water with lower specific conductance and lower concentrations of chloride, lead, inorganic nitrogen, suspended solids and total and dissolved phosphorus than basins with fewer wetlands. \r\n<p>Wetlands are a major sink (where material is trapped and held) for heavy metals and for sulfur, which combines with metals to form relatively insoluble compounds. \r\n<p>The ability of wetlands to filter and transform nutrients and other constituents has resulted in the construction and use of artificial wetlands in the United States and other countries to treat wastewater and acid mine drainage. \r\n<p>One of the best known functions of wetlands is to provide habitat for birds.

Cronin, research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. \"The rise and fall in the number of species of ostracodes during 11 glacial cycles suggests that the effects of any future global climate change-whether natural or manmade-could further affect the richness of life on Earth beyond the risk already posed by habitat degradation and other environmental effects.\" \r\n<p>Cronin and coauthor Dr. Maureen E. Raymo, Associate Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reported in the February 13, 1997, issue of Nature that the biodiversity of bottom-dwelling communities living in the abyssal North Atlantic Ocean has been unstable in the face of past global climatic changes. \r\n<p>They measured how trends in the biodiversity of fossilized ostracodes varied over a half-million year interval of alternating cold (glacial) and warm (interglacial) climates. The microscopic fossil shells were preserved in deep-sea sediment cores recovered from the North Atlantic Ocean by the Ocean Drilling Program. \r\n<p>By comparing the trends in biodiversity with global climate change as determined from the chemistry of the shells, the authors were able to establish a statistical correspondence between diversity and climate changes that were caused by cycles of the Earth&rsquo;s orbit relative to the sun. The astronomical or orbital theory of climate holds that changes in the seasonal and geographical distribution of the sun&rsquo;s energy reaching the upper atmosphere strongly influence Earth&rsquo;s climate over tens of thousands of years. Today the Earth tilts at 23.5 degrees relative to its plane of orbit, causing the seasons, but tilt has varied from about 22 to 25 degrees in the past due to changing gravitational effects from the other planets. These changes in the Earth&rsquo;s tilt alter the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth at different latitudes. \r\n<p>Cronin and Raymo discovered that orbital cycles of tilt also influence biodiversity: diverse species-rich communities characterize warm interglacial periods like today (high tilt), while diversity drops significantly during glacial periods when global ice sheets expand in size (low tilt). \r\n<p>The mechanisms that cause diversity to change are still unclear but Cronin and Raymo propose that changes in solar radiation initiate a chain reaction that reduces the productivity of surface ocean plankton communities. This in turn leads to less food resources settling through the water to the sea floor, ultimately limiting the species that can survive in the bottom community. During glacial periods, some abyssal species migrate to shallower refuges around the ocean margins, returning to the abyss during the next warm interglacial. Climate changes also altered deep-sea circulation leading to changes in deep-sea nutrients and temperatures. Competitive and predator-prey interactions among species may also be disturbed by limited food resources and changes in bottom water temperatures. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"855810000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169271"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"USGS Scientist Describes Possibilities For Life On Mars","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>\"There is mounting evidence that Mars is a water-rich planet that may have experienced warmer climates, and therefore, life, in the past,\"according to Michael Carr, an astrogeologist with the U.S.Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. \n<p>\"Furthermore,\" said Dr. Carr, \"early terrestrial life may have evolved in hydrothermal environments resembling those in Yellowstone Park and along mid-ocean ridges and such environments were likely common on early Mars.\" \r\n<p>Carr presented his assessment of the possibilities of life on Mars at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in Seattle, on Thursday, Feb. 13. \r\n<p>Carr said that both Earth and Mars experienced an early era of heavy meteorite bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago.

Starting at Mount St. Helens in 1980 and continuing to the present day, USGS scientists have responded to dozens of volcano crises in the United States and elsewhere. By assessing hazards from future eruptions based on a volcano&rsquo;s past behavior, carefully monitoring for signs of restlessness, and keeping public officials informed of the dangers, scientists have helped to save thousands of lives and millions of dollars worth of property throughout the world. \r\n<p>\"Enjoy the movies,\" Tilling said, \"but remember that natural processes like volcanic eruptions only turn into natural disasters when humans get in the way. We can live in harmony with our active volcanoes, but only if we respect their power and plan accordingly.\" \r\n<p>\"Not all hazards from eruptions are limited to the immediate vicinity of the volcano,\" said Dan Dzurisin, scientist-in-charge at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory (CVO) in Vancouver, Wash. \"Huge debris avalanches and associated volcanic mudflows, such as those at Mount St. Helens in 1980, can travel tens of miles down valleys surrounding a volcano. In some cases, it may be safer to be closer to an erupting volcano and on high ground than it is to be farther away and on the floor of a valley.\" \r\n<p>Even more far-reaching than avalanches and mudflows are plumes of volcanic ash, shot high into the atmosphere, that could damage or even bring down an airliner hundreds of miles from an erupting volcano. This has become a serious problem in recent years as air traffic through some of the world&rsquo;s worst \"volcano shooting galleries\" has increased dramatically. \"A prime example is our own Aleutian volcanic chain in Alaska,\" said Terry Keith, scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO), a facility jointly operated by the USGS, Fairbanks Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska, and Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. Every day, dozens of planes fly over or near some of the Aleutian&rsquo;s most active volcanoes. In 1989, a Boeing 747-400 aircraft descended into what appeared to be a thin haze layer while on approach to Anchorage International Airport. In fact, the \"haze\" was volcanic ash from a small eruption of nearby Redoubt volcano. The jumbo jet lost power from all four engines for several agonizing minutes before the crew was able to restart them and land safely. Although no one was injured, damage to the plane was approximately $80 million. To avoid such costly and potentially deadly encounters in the future, the USGS, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Weather Service are working with similar agencies around the world to provide timely warnings of dangerous ash plumes. \"Last year, we installed monitoring equipment on four additional volcanoes in the Aleutians, and this year we&rsquo;ll start monitoring four more,\" said Keith. \r\n<p>Hazards from an erupting volcano can take many forms, including blasts, debris avalanches and debris flows, pyroclastic flows, lava flows, ashfall and poisonous gases. \"By studying a volcano&rsquo;s eruptive history, we can get a pretty good idea of which hazards pose the greatest risks,\" according to USGS researcher Kevin Scott. \"At Mount Rainier, for example, we know that debris flows have repeatedly buried all of the valleys s","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"854773200","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Checking the Nations&rsquo;s Streams... 1996 Was A Very Wet Year And Early 1997 Continutes The Pace","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Streamflow was well above normal in about half the country last year and with the major flooding in California, Nevada and the Pacific Northwest over the New Year and again in late January, the trend seems to be continuing right into 1997, according to scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey. \n<p>Of the 173 key index stations in the USGS reporting network of streamgaging stations across the country, 50 percent of the stations recorded flows for 1996 that were well above normal -- in the highest 25 percent of the historic record.

Previous record high was 85.1 bgd in 1972, the year of Hurricane Agnes. \r\n<p>The high flows also carried increased amounts of sediment, nutrients, and other chemicals that affected the water quality and living resources of the Bay. The environmental effects could have been much worse, however, according to preliminary information collected by the agencies involved in the cooperative Chesapeake Bay Program. \r\n<p>\"The repeated high waters and floods of 1996 caused obvious and serious economic damage throughout the upstream Chesapeake basin. Less well understood are the environmental effects of those record inflows to the Bay itself,\" according to Scott Phillips, coordinator of the USGS Chesapeake Bay effort, Towson, Md. \r\n<p>\"Although the record freshwater inflows damaged and caused localized losses to vegetation and oyster beds, the total impact on the Bay ecosystem probably did not match the damage from the previous record flow year of 1972,\" Phillips said. \r\n<p>\"Two primary factors -- the timing of the large storms and the success of management actions to reduce nutrients entering the Bay -- lessened the potential effects of the high flows,\" the USGS spokesman said. \r\n<p>These favorable factors include: \r\n<p>* The highest flows in 1996 hit in January and December, when underwater plants and grasses are not growing. The grasses are an important habitat for crabs and food for waterfowl. In 1972, the high flows came in the summer, which is a very productive time for grasses and other living resources in the Bay. \r\n<p>* Information the USGS is collecting in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations have decreased since the 1980s in most of the major rivers draining to the Bay, due to implementation of nutrient management actions. As a result, the amount of nutrients entering the Bay, though large, was less than it would have been under previous management practices. \r\n<p>Chesapeake Bay Program agencies reported that high flows in 1996 affected the Bay in several ways: \r\n<p>* The increased flows decrease the salinity of the Bay and make the water fresher. The unusually low salinities in 1996 resulted in localized oyster mortalities in Maryland and the Potomac River. The low salinity, however, may help keep the oyster diseases, MSX and Dermo, in check, allowing surviving oysters to grow. \r\n<p>* The large amount of nutrients brought in by the rivers caused a large spring algal bloom. This bloom, along with high sediment inputs, decreased the amount of light available to underwater grasses and plants, which are important as nurseries for young and larval forms of creatures in the Bay. High flows in 1993 and 1994 resulted in slightly decreased plant growth for the next two years. More losses may result in 1997 from the high 1996 flows. \r\n<p>* The algal blooms contributed to low dissolved oxygen counts in the bottom waters of the Maryland portion of the Bay, but not record lows. \r\n<p>* Fish and crabs are not expected to show long-term effects from the 1996 high flows. \r\n<p>* As a result of high water levels in the nontidal portion of the Potomac River all during the growing season, submerged aquatic vegetation disappeared almost completely between Harpers Ferry and Great Falls.

Records began in 1907. \r\n<p>* The South Fork American River near Camino, a major stream flowing into Folsom Reservoir (just east of Sacramento) flowing at approximately 70,000 ft3\/s (cubic feet per second) exceeds the previous record by 20,200 ft3\/s. Records began in 1922. \r\n<p>* The Napa River near St. Helena crested January 2 just below the previous peak of record set in 1986. \r\n<p>Idaho--Melting snow has caused widespread and rapid runoff. Many rock and mudslides have closed several central-Idaho highways, and many have also been washed out by high flows and mudslides. Flows of the Payette River in Gem County and the Weiser River in Washington County are expected to reach or exceed the 100-year recurrence interval discharge. (A 100-year recurrence interval means that there is a 1 % chance of an equivalent flood occurring in any given year.) Water levels on several other rivers in south-central Idaho continue to rise. \r\n<p>Nevada--Warm rain in the Sierra is rapidly melting the substantial snowpack. Resultant flooding in northwest Nevada has approached, and in some cases exceeded, peaks of record in the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers and their tributaries.

Unfortunately, many potential users either do not know that it exists or do not know how to access it. This initiative will make use of base standards that are so essential for people to find the environmental data and information they need.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The agreement was reached among representatives to the Global Information Society initiative, which was convened at the suggestion of Vice President Gore and organized by the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Commission). The leaders of the Environment and Natural Resources Management project are Larry Enomoto of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Eliot Christian of the United States Geological Survey (USGS).<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The service standard is designed to make information easy to find,\" said Christian. \"It is a natural complement to the World Wide Web that is such a wonderful tool for presentation.

Kayen said his method differs from past methods because it incorporates earthquake magnitude and duration and needs no corrections for such factors. <\/p>\r\n<p>Kayen and fellow researcher, James Mitchell of Virginia Tech University, developed the innovative technique using computer models of earthquake waves as they propagate through soil to estimate the \"Arias\" intensity below the ground surface. The authors consider this new measure of earthquake shaking severity to be significantly more reliable than the conventional method of assessing liquefaction. <\/p>\r\n<p>Central to the Arias intensity method is a graph of data from 81 soil sites in the United States and Japan that have undergone known levels of earthquake shaking. Along the horizontal axis is the strength of the soil layers below the ground surface, a property that can be measured by two techniques--the Standard Penetration Test and the cone penetration test--which are already used around the world for construction. On the vertical axis is Arias intensity, a quantitative measure of earthquake shaking severity that is energy-based, not stress-based as in conventional liquefaction assessments. For each site, Kayen and Mitchell either measured ground properties themselves or used published measurements. They plotted those properties against earthquake shaking intensities determined from seismograms recorded on the ground near the sites and modified to estimate the intensity below the ground at the depth of the various soil layers. They noted on the plot whether the soil at each site had liquefied or not, and discovered a sharp boundary on the plot between sites that had liquefied and sites that had not. <\/p>\r\n<p>Kayen said the new method will allow civil engineers to use common soil-foundation tests along with estimates of earthquake shaking intensity to predict the likelihood of soil liquefaction at a given site, and guide engineers on how much to improve the soil strength at the site to help it resist liquefaction. <\/p>\r\n<p>Liquefaction typically occurs in sandy, water-saturated soils such as floodplain deposits, delta deposits, alluvial sediments, and landfill. During earthquake shaking, water pressure in tiny spaces, or pores, within the soil are elevated temporarily, usually for a matter of minutes. <\/p>\r\n<p>During that time, Kayen said, the high pore pressures can cause soil to lose nearly all its strength, and potentially cause the soil to flow like a liquid. Soil that had previously supported large structures cannot support them when it is in a liquefied state. \"Much of the worst damage from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake resulted from settlement and failure of the foundations of structures when the soil beneath them liquefied,\" Kayen said. <\/p>\r\n<p>Up until now, Kayen said, liquefaction potential has been assessed by a conventional engineering method based on the peak stress exerted on soil during an earthquake. \"But earthquakes of different magnitudes and durations can exert the same peak stress on a soil while subjecting the soil to very different levels of earthquake shaking intensity; the greater the magnitude and\/or duration of the earthquake, the greater the number of damaging waves that propagate through the soil. \"So, conventional, stress-based methods have to be corrected for factors such as earthquake magnitude and duration,\" Kayen said, \"and Arias intensity incorporates these factors.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Kayen said that by using the new model, engineers can plot their own sites on this graph","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"850712400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170214"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Radioactive Waste Disposal Problems In The Russian Far East","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Radioactive waste, the legacy of the \"Cold War,\" is a problem for all nations, and nowhere is the problem more of a reality than in the Russian Far East.

Nuclear reactor cores and spent fuel rods are stored at a number of naval facilities, awaiting eventual disposal and reprocessing. Some of these facilities are adjacent to population centers.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Molnia said the dumping and storage has resulted in many potential problems for the Russian Far East: to reprocess the volume of existing stored waste would require many years of the national reprocessing capability; moreover, annual production of new waste through submarine decommissioning also exceeds the national annual reprocessing capability; plus the Russian Federation lacks the transportation capability to move the ever increasing volume of high-level waste away from the coastal area. <\/p>\r\n<p>He said representatives from the Russian Navy&rsquo;s Pacific Fleet Chemical Service are fully aware of the grave situation and have openly cooperated in discussing potential problems and solutions to this situation. \"They have appealed for international cooperation and assistance.

The scientists focused on the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Washington and Oregon, where the oceanic Juan de Fuca plate is sliding eastward beneath the continental North American plate. <\/p>\r\n<p>Using processes called multichannel seismic reflection and wide-angle seismic refraction, the scientists bounced sound waves off deeply buried layers of rock and sediment to produce cross-sectional images of the subduction zone down to 40 kilometers below the surface. <\/p>\r\n<p>Calling the project \"a spectacular success,\" Fisher said sound waves from multichannel seismic lines show the downgoing oceanic plate 120 kilometers eastward from the trench. \"Using these data, I&rsquo;m confident that we can make decisive statements about the earthquake environment of the Cascadia subduction zone.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Fisher said the geometry of the rock layers in and around the subduction zone shed light on earthquake hazards in a number of ways. For example: <\/p>\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>The angle of the fault surface along which an earthquake occurs influences the direction in which the greatest energy from the earthquake travels. Knowing the angle of the fault surface between the two plates (the decollement) will help scientists determine what areas on land are likely to experience the greatest shaking from earthquakes generated along the decollement. <br><\/LI>\r\n<LI>The geometry and material properties of the accretionary wedge--the pile of sediment that is scraped off the downgoing plate and plastered onto the overriding plate--tells scientists a lot about how much friction exists along the fault surface that separates the plates (the decollement). The greater the friction along the decollement, the greater the likelihood that the movement of the plates past one another will generate earthquakes. <\/LI><\/OL>\r\n<p>While Fisher and his colleagues were conducting their research at sea, Tom Parsons, also of the USGS, led an onshore crew that set up and maintained three east-west lines of seismometers to extend the Sonne results across western Washington.

USGS scientists reported on their various studies at the session. <\/p>\r\n<p>MTBE, derived from natural gas, is added to gasoline in many parts of the United States to increase the octane level or to reduce carbon monoxide and ozone levels in the air. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency tentatively classifies MTBE as a possible human carcinogen, which has prompted continued study of its effects on the environment. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS scientists said MTBE was detected in one or more stormwater samples in eight cities -- Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Colorado Springs, Denver, Dallas\/Fort Worth, San Antonio and Phoenix. The detection rate in urban stormwater was highest (34 out of 41 samples) in samples collected during the months of October through March each year of the study (1991-95). This October-March detection window corresponds with the expected seasonal use of oxygenated gasoline in areas where carbon monoxide exceeds established air-quality standards. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS work is part of an interagency assessment of the scientific basis and effectiveness of the nation&rsquo;s oxygenated fuel program, which is coordinated by the President&rsquo;s Office of Science and Technology Policy. The request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for this assessment was prompted by public complaints of headaches, nausea and other acute symptoms attributed to winter-time use of oxygenated gasoline, as well as complaints of reductions in gasoline economy and engine performance. <\/p>\r\n<p>Oxygenates, such as MTBE, reduce the need for benzene and other ozone-forming, aromatic compounds in gasoline. MTBE, however, is less biodegradable than common gasoline compounds, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and total xylene (BTEX). <\/p>\r\n<p>Concentrations of 62 volatile organic compounds (VOC&rsquo;s) and other constituents were measured in 592 stormwater samples collected in the 16 cities in 11 states, all of which have a population greater than 100,000. MTBE was the seventh most frequently detected VOC and was detected in 41 of the 592 stormwater samples collected. In decreasing order, the most frequently detected VOC&rsquo;s were toluene, total xylene, chloroform, trimethylbenzene, tetrachloroethene and naphthalene. VOC&rsquo;s are of concern because they are easily changed into gaseous form (volatilized) and, therefore, available to the air and water. <\/p>\r\n<p>In each of the three cities -- Phoenix, Colorado Springs and Denver -- known to use MTBE, it was detected only in stormwater samples collected during the season when oxygenated gasoline was in use. MTBE was detected in 40 percent of the samples collected in these three cities during October through March. <\/p>\r\n<p>Detection of MTBE in cities confirmed not to use oxygenated gasoline -- Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Dallas\/Fort Worth and San Antonio -- may be attributable to the use of MTBE as an octane enhancer. <\/p>\r\n<p>The cities sampled are required by the Clean Water Act to obtain permits for stormwater discharged from municipal separate stormwater systems into surface water.

More detailed follow-up studies are needed to determine whether fish populations are being affected. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS scientists presented findings from the multi-agency studies this week (Nov. 19, 1996) at the annual meeting of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in Washington, D.C. The studies are part of a broad-based effort led by the USGS to investigate the effectiveness of new methods for monitoring endocrine disruption in fish in freshwater environments. <\/p>\r\n<p>The methods, developed by researchers at the University of Florida, were used to gather evidence on how widespread endocrine disruption in fish may be in the United States and to evaluate potential relationships between endocrine disruption and levels of contaminants. <\/p>\r\n<p>Both studies focused on carp, a common and widely distributed fish species. Carp are bottom-dwelling fish whose feeding habits expose them to contaminants found in the water, sediments and food. The studies were based on data on contaminants and other water-quality characteristics that were collected as part of the USGS National Water Quality Assessment Program. <\/p>\r\n<p>One study, a national reconnaissance of sex steroid hormones in fish, investigated evidence of endocrine disruption at 25 sites that represented a wide range of environmental conditions in selected watersheds across the country. The national study represents the largest data set to date looking at endocrine disruption in fish, particularly carp. The other study looked specifically at contaminants and potential endocrine disruption effects on fish in the Las Vegas Bay of Lake Mead, Nev., a popular public recreation area managed by the National Park Service. <\/p>\r\n<p>The national study showed significant differences in sex steroid hormones from many streams within major regions of the country. The study also identified significant differences in vitellogenin, an estrogen-controlled protein necessary for egg development in fish and birds, among the 25 sampling sites. Although some of these differences probably result from natural variability, correlations between contaminants and the levels of hormones and vitellogenin in carp indicate that some of the site-to-site differences were associated with certain environmental contaminant groups. <\/p>\r\n<p>The second study examined the occurrence of organic chemicals -- pesticides and other compounds -- in water, bottom sediments and carp in Las Vegas Wash and two nearby bays -- Las Vegas and Callville -- in Lake Mead. Pesticide concentrations were found to be higher in Las Vegas Wash and Las Vegas Bay than in Callville Bay, the study&rsquo;s reference site. Similarly, several industrial chemicals were detected in higher concentrations in bottom-sediment samples from Las Vegas Bay than in samples from Callville Bay. Many of the detected compounds have been linked in other studies to the disruption of endocrine systems, which control reproductive functions in the fish. <\/p>\r\n<p>The most notable evidence of endocrine disruption that was determined by the USGS study is the presence of female egg protein in blood-plasma samples of male carp from Las Vegas Wash and Bay and elevated concentrations in female carp from Las Vegas Bay. <\/p>\r\n<p>USGS officials cautioned that while the findings are an important guidepost, they cannot begin to answer questions about human health, pointing the way to a need for more detailed study. \"Endocrine disruptors have become a popular concern,\" said Dr. Dennis Fenn, USGS chief biologist, \"and these findings suggest the potential for a significant problem.

USGS scientists estimated that during the first nine months of 1996, about 263 million pounds of nitrogen and 18 million pounds of phosphorus entered into the Chesapeake Bay from the major tributary rivers. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"The amount of nitrogen is about 50% higher and phosphorus is about twice the normal amount that usually enters the Bay,\" according to Scott Phillips, Towson, Md., coordinator of the USGS Chesapeake Bay Science Program. \"But the pollution loads could have been much higher if mitigation measures had not been implemented by Federal, State and local agencies to reduce the amount of nutrients that enter the Bay.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Information the USGS is collecting, in cooperation with Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations have decreased during the past decade in most of the major rivers entering the Bay. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"The Potomac River, for example, has transported about 87 million pounds of nitrogen and 7 million pounds of phosphorus to the Bay during 1996,\" Phillips said. \"If nutrient reduction methods had not been implemented within the Potomac River basin, we estimate over 100 million pounds of nitrogen and 10 million pounds of phosphorus could have entered the Bay. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"That is quite a reduction,\" Phillips said. \" And when you take into account reductions in nutrients from all of the rivers monitored, it is clear that some of the efforts to clean up the Bay are working.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The increased nutrient pollution can cause algal blooms in the Bay. The algal blooms, along with high sediment loads, can decrease the amount of light that is available for underwater grasses and plants. The grasses and plants are important habitat for crabs and a food source for waterfowl. Also, when algae die and decay, they use up oxygen in the water. When oxygen in the water gets too low, the living resources of the Bay can be at risk. <\/p>\r\n<p>Comprehensive efforts to reduce nutrients into the Chesapeake Bay began in 1987 through a coordinated effort of Federal and State agencies, which are part of the interagency Chesapeake Bay Program, established in 1983 to restore and manage resources of the Bay. <\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Maryland","Virginia"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"844660800","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169271"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"New U.S. Geological Survey Names First Chief Biologist","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Dr. Dennis B.

Dr. Farmer was recognized for his achievements in using remote sensing to investigate chemical processes leading to the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Dr. McCormick was honored for his contributions to the pioneering advancements of both active and passive remote sensing of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere from space. <\/p>\n<p>The award, which is sponsored jointly by the Department of the Interior and NASA, recognizes outstanding contributions to the understanding of the Earth by means of remote sensing. It has been presented annually since 1974 to honor the memory of Dr. William T. Pecora, whose early vision and support helped establish what we know today as the Landsat satellite program. Dr. Pecora was Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from 1965-71, and later served as Undersecretary, Department of the Interior, until his death in 1972. <\/p>\r\n<p>The 1996 awards were presented August 21 during the Pecora Thirteen Symposium, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, by Dr. Dallas L. Peck, USGS Emeritus Scientist and former USGS Director, and Dr. Nancy Maynard, Deputy Director of the Science Division of NASA&rsquo;s Office of Mission to Planet Earth. As part of the ceremony, Mrs. Ethelwyn Pecora, Dr. Pecora&rsquo;s widow, recalled her husband&rsquo;s early support for a U.S. civilian Earth-observation program, as well as his love for earth science and his keen sense of humor. <\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Crofton B. Farmer, Pasadena, California <\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Farmer is an internationally renowned atmospheric physicist who led the development of near-infrared spectroscopy for making highly sensitive atmospheric measurements. He was awarded the first of three NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals for developing an instrument to simultaneously measure the concentrations of many important chemical compounds in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. For more than 20 years, he has provided insightful leadership in the NASA stratospheric measurements program that contributed significantly to understanding the ozone depletion phenomenon over Antarctica. He developed an instrument used aboard the Space Shuttle in 1985 to obtain precise measurements of the spatial and temporal variation of nearly all the major interacting species in the upper atmosphere so that the complex process of ozone depletion chemistry could be examined. <\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. Farmer has been associated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., for many years, where he is now a Distinguished Visiting Scientist and consultant. <\/p>\r\n<p>Dr. M.

Trends in dissolved oxygen and nutrients are reconstructed using phytoplankton, bottom-dwelling organisms, and chemical signatures in the sediment and can be linked to past changes in climate, rainfall, salinity etc. One ultimate goal of this research is to determine ecosystem response to nutrient and sediment reduction by establishing relationships between past events and Bay habitats through an understanding of natural cycles. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>USGS participation in this sample-colle","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"843192000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169271"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Art Meets Science at U.S. Geologicaly Survey Employee Art Show","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>See the artistic talents of your friends and neighbors who work at the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston displayed in an employee art show, Sept. 3-30, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. <\/p>\n<p>The show subject matter includes brochures, posters and figures from USGS publications depicting a wide range of earth science subjects such as volcanoes, earthquakes, floods, and landslides.

Homeowners in the path of the storm check their insurance policies and their shutters, vacationers decide to head inland or take their chances at the beach--and all over the U.S. Geological Survey, people get busy. Before, during, and after, the USGS helps hurricane-prone areas by providing detailed maps of the affected areas to rescue and recovery workers, by tracking flooding, and by documenting coastal erosion. <\/p>\n<p>As Hurricane Fran approaches the United States, the USGS Emergency Response Team is on alert. One of their first priorities is providing maps of the affected areas to emergency response personnel from local, state, and federal agencies. The task is hard--it takes roughly 55,000 quadrangle maps to cover the United States and its territories, not including Alaska. Just finding adequate supplies of the right maps for Hurricane Alley along the East and Gulf Coasts, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands could be challenging. <\/p>\r\n<p>Most map requests will come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Defense Mapping Agency. \"We rely on the USGS maps to give us the information we need in a disaster situation,\" says Greg Millett, of the American Red Cross National Disaster Operations Center. \"The large format of the 1:100,000-scale maps helps us plot the boundaries of a disaster and determine how many households are involved, so we know how much food, clothing, and shelter will be required. The USGS maps contain all the information we need, and they&rsquo;re not cluttered up with extraneous information on landmarks and attractions that most commercial road maps carry.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>While the first maps are being distributed, USGS flood crews are also at work. USGS hydrologists cooperate with other Federal agencies, particularly FEMA, to collect data on storm surges (abnormally high tides caused by storm winds) and river flooding. Surprisingly, during many hurricanes, flooding causes more damage than high winds. The USGS national network of streamflow gaging stations provides data on river stages and discharges to the NOAA\/National Weather Service in real time for forecasting floods. USGS real-time water data are available on the World Wide Web at <a href=\"http:\/\/h2o.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/h2o.usgs.gov<\/a>; scroll down to and click on Real-Time Hydrologic Data, then click on the state you are interested in. <\/p>\r\n<p>One lasting legacy of hurricanes is vastly accelerated coastal erosion, and USGS geologists have been studying the erosion caused by hurricanes for a number of years.

The federal drinking water standard for atrazine, the most widely used herbicide in the nation, is set at 3.0 ppb. However, the standard applies to average annual concentrations in finished drinking water, and these short-term conditions pose no health threat. By June 22, atrazine concentrations in the river had dropped to less than 3.0 ppb. <\/p>\r\n<p>The Potomac River provides the public water supply to a large portion of the metropolitan Washington, D.C area. Upon receiving the data from the USGS, the EPA immediately requested historic and more recent sampling data from water companies which withdraw from the Potomac. These facilities reported atrazine concentrations far below the drinking water standard in both raw and finished water. Follow-up sampling at the Washington Aqueduct by EPA showed atrazine concentrations were less than 0.1 ppb in early August. The aqueduct is the water treatment facility that supplies the District of Columbia and several suburban Virginia communities. Based on analysis of these data, the EPA is taking the following steps: <\/p>\r\n<p>-Coordinating more closely with USGS on data sharing. <\/p>\r\n<p>-Recommending more frequent sampling for raw and finished water from water utilities in the metropolitan area during May and June, when herbicide use is heaviest and when storm events are most likely to cause elevated instream concentrations. <\/p>\r\n<p>The USGS and EPA are working with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Virginia Department of Health, and Washington area water suppliers to evaluate whether, under the same circumstances, other pollutants could affect drinking water quality. <\/p>\r\n<p>New provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act emphasize protection of water-supply sources, in order to improve public health-protection and drinking-water quality, as well as to reduce the cost of treatment. <\/p>\r\n<p>Additional background from USGS: <\/p>\r\n<p>* The June flooding was greatest in the Monocacy River, a tributary of the Potomac, where streamflow reached a record high near Bridgeport, Md.

Monitoring results from 1992-1994 show an average concentration of 0.16 ppb and a peak of 0.5ppb. <\/p>\r\n<p>* As a result of the June flooding, the USGS estimates that about 4,300 pounds of atrazine were transported to the tidal Potomac River, mostly from Conococheague Creek and the Monocacy River.

Sheldon was formerly Chief Geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., and was widely recognized as an expert on world phosphate resources. He had lived in Washington since 1968. <\/p>\n<p>Sheldon joined the USGS in 1947 to study phosphate deposits of the western U.S. He spent most of his career with the USGS, except for a brief stint as an independent and oil company geologist. Also, from 1964 to 1965, he was a visiting professor of geology at Yale University. During his career with the USGS, Sheldon served in a variety of research and managerial positions. His research publications included reports on phosphates, oil, and iron ore, and he undertook assignments in Turkey, Chile, Peru, Iran, the Middle East, and several countries in Southeast Asia, in addition to domestic geologic studies. From 1967 to 1968 he was Chief of the Organic Fuels Branch in Denver. He followed that assignment with four years as Assistant Chief Geologist for Mineral Resources in Washington, D.C. In 1972, he was appointed Chief Geologist and served in that capacity until 1977. During his tenure as Chief Geologist, he successfully guided a major increase in research programs for energy and mineral studies, including the acquisition of a research vessel from the U.S. Navy that provided the USGS access to the underwater continental margins for the first time. He also supported the increased use of computers and data systems to improve the efficiency and quality of division programs and products. After stepping down as Chief Geologist in 1977, Sheldon continued his work as a senior research geologist until his retirement in 1982. <\/p>\r\n<p>Sheldon was a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Other professional affiliations included the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Society of Economic Geologists, Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Sigma Xi, Geological Society of Washington and the Cosmos Club. <\/p>\r\n<p>Sheldon received the Meritorious Service Award (1973) and the Distinguished Service Award (1976) of the Department of the Interior. In 1987, he was honored with the Human Needs Award of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists for outstanding research on phosphate supplies to serve the needs of developing countries. <\/p>\r\n<p>Sheldon is also remembered as an enthusiastic actor in the satirical comedies produced by the Pick and Hammer Club of the USGS. Sheldon was born in Tulsa, Okla., on October 25, 1923. He had a B.S. degree in geology from Yale University and a Ph.D. in geology from Stanford University.

From evidence of liquefaction, it is estimated to have had a magnitude of 7.5. Another strong earthquake (about magnitude 7) occurred about 12,000 years ago. Evidence of liquefaction was found also along the Sangamon, White and Kaskaskia rivers for other large earthquakes greater than magnitude 5.5. These earthquakes occurred outside of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, which produced a series of magnitude 8 earthquakes in 1811 and 1812.<\/p>\r\n<p>Evidence of liquefaction was found by scouting river banks from canoes and small motor boats and searching for liquefaction features in exposures of sediments. Liquefaction involves changing water-saturated sand from a solid to a liquid that does not support weight. With the onset of strong shaking, the water-saturated sand begins to form a water \"slurry.\" As the pressure of the water slurry increases, sand and silt are \"squirted\" into cracks that may rupture at the surface. Sand and water that vent at the surface form \"sand blows.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Many sand blows examples were found throughout the Wabash River Valley. By using an innovative technique to collect organic materials (wood, charcoal, etc.) from layers of silt and clay above and below a sand layer, the scientists were able to determine when the sand blow formed. Radiocarbon dating was especially successful because there were fragments of charcoal from buried Indian hearths at several of the venting sites. The vents were also dated using diagnostic artifacts such as arrowheads, spear points and pottery, that were crafted for only brief time periods. <\/p>\r\n<p>The estimated size of each earthquake was determined by several factors. First, only earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.5 are capable of producing widespread liquefaction. Second, the areal extent of liquefaction correlates with the vigor of the ground shaking. The stronger the earthquake, the more widespread and stronger the shaking. <\/p>\r\n<p>Obermeier, Garniewicz, and Munson will present their findings at the meeting of the Seismological Society of America on Wednesday, April 3, 1996, in St. Louis, Missouri.

But our results should prove very useful as a baseline to gage future success, and to help water managers pinpoint likely problem areas. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"More than three dozen USGS scientists have been involved in this intensive study as well as dozens of scientists from dozens of Federal, state and local agencies up and down the river basin,\" Hirsch said. \"But the organizational and inspirational credit goes to Dr. Robert Meade, USGS senior hydrologist in Denver, who practiced many years on the Amazon and other big rivers before he was ready to lead the way on the Mississippi.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Highlights of some of the results from the USGS report: <\/p>\r\n<p>Fecal coliform bacteria, derived from human and animal wastes, survive only briefly in river water; however, in much of the Mississippi River their average concentrations exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (U.S. EPA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) for recreational use. <\/p>\r\n<p>A biodegradable detergent (linear alkylbenzen sulfonate or LAS), frequently found in domestic sewage, is present in the river in the St. Louis metropolitan area. It corresponds with the concentrations of coliform bacteria that exceed the MCL for recreational use, probably reflecting input of wastewaters into the river. <\/p>\r\n<p>Caffeine, found in coffee and soft drinks consumed only by humans, is found in domestic sewage and can be used to illustrate the extent to which sewage is diluted by the Mississippi River. Concentrations of caffeine in the river indicate that domestic sewage may be diluted as much as a thousandfold. <\/p>\r\n<p>Concentrations of agricultural contaminants--pesticides and nutrients--in the river vary seasonally and are greatest following rainstorms that occur soon after they are applied to croplands. <\/p>\r\n<p>The discharge of high concentrations of nitrate into the Gulf of Mexico accentuates the cycle of fertilization, decay, and oxygen depletion in the offshore waters of Louisiana. <\/p>\r\n<p>Concentrations of dissolved heavy metals, like lead and mercury, which partly reflect the industrial and mining activities in the Mississippi River basin, are well below the drinking-water standards by factors of at least 100. However, lead and other metals can be adsorbed onto sediment particles. In some parts of the upper Mississippi River, sediments have large enough concentrations of adsorbed lead to be considered moderately polluted (40 micrograms of lead per gram of sediment) to highly polluted (60 micrograms of lead per gram of sediment). <\/p>\r\n<p>Thousands of samples were collected for this study from 1987 through 1992, during 10 separate sampling trips that were timed to show the effects of high water, low water, rising water levels, and falling water levels.

Anderson, chief of USGS hydrologic investigations and research, Tucson, Ariz. \"We&rsquo;ve stuck our scientific necks out and made a prediction as to how the increased flow will move sand around and build beaches downstream. This flood will produce scientific data that is needed to expand the usefulness of models used to predict the effects of higher flows on other rivers in the country.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>Anderson noted that understanding how sand and sediment moves through our river systems is a major concern across the country for many reasons, including preservation of depositional features like the Colorado beaches, as a problem in clearing navigational channels, and in studying how sediments retain and move pollutants such as DDT, long after their use has stopped. The scheduled release of 45,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water over a six day period is a test flow to determine if a higher than usual flow can rebuild beaches and sandbars that have deteriorated during 20 years of controlled, lower flows from the dam. The higher-volume test flow also is expected to clean silt out of backwater channels that provide fish habitats. Glen Canyon Dam stores and releases water from Lake Powell. Water can be can be released from the dam through the power plant (up to 32,000 cfs); the outlet works (up to 15,000 cfs); and the spillways, up to 208,000 cfs. During day-to-day operation, releases are varied to meet power demands, with maximum discharges generally held below the 32,200 cfs that can flow through the power plant. Since 1991 maximum discharges have been limited to 20,000 cfs, pending the completion of environmental studies. <\/p>\r\n<p>Because most of the sand that used to be washed yearly into the Grand Canyon is now trapped behind Glen Canyon Dam, sandbars that erode away might never be replaced. The controlled and reduced flows also mean that sand is not being washed out of the Grand Canyon nearly as fast as under natural conditions before the dam was built, so there is little rearranging of sandbars. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"Sandbars are disappearing in the canyon, not because of a lack of sediment coming through the Glen Canyon gates,\" Anderson said, \"but because of a lack of floods.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The test flow planned for March 26 through April 1 is expected to lift sand out of deep pools in the river channel, where much of it now rests, and deposit it on bars along the banks, possibly adding a few feet to sandbars in the canyon. <\/p>\r\n<p>During the test flow, USGS scientists will use current meters to measure water velocities and optical devices to measure how much sediment is suspended in the water.

USBM was abolished by Congress in January 1996, but about 190 federal and contract employees and support staff that had prepared these and other reports were transferred to the USGS in Reston, Va., and Lakewood, Colo., in late January. <\/p>\r\n<p>\"The return of these people to the USGS is like welcoming part of our original family home again,\" said Director Eaton. \"The Bureau of Mines was formally established by Congress in 1910, with the Technologic Branch of the USGS as its nucleus. Later, in 1923, the mineral statistics work of the USGS was transferred to the Bureau of Mines. Now, with the recombining of the minerals information function with the USGS, there is a new synergy in the minerals area and an opportunity for new collaborative efforts.\" <\/p>\r\n<p>The core activity of the minerals information group is the collection and dissemination of information on mineral production, consumption, and trade for about 100 mineral commodities. The group receives about 50,000 responses each year from 160 surveys of domestic minerals producers and also collects international data from 190 countries through government sources, trades associations, and published sources. These data are important for tracking domestic and international economic trends and resource development. <\/p>\r\n<p>The information is available to the public through more than 100 publications, including the well-known Minerals Yearbook, and through electronic access, including FaxBack, Bulletin Board, the Internet, and CD-ROM.

They depict natural and cultural features of the landscape, such as lakes and streams, highways and railroads, boundaries, elevation, and geographic names. Over the years they have been popular with the general public for outdoor, particularly recreational, uses and with scientists and engineers in support of research and technical applications. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Donald M. Hoskins, Pennsylvania State Geologist, and an early supporter of the program, met with the USGS in December 1994 to establish the first cooperative agreement to produce DRGs of Pennsylvania. Many other state agreements have since been signed with the USGS, and production work is underway. CD-ROMs for parts of Pennsylvania and Washington state are available, with full coverage of the U.S. expected by 1998, after some 57,000 USGS maps are converted to CD-ROM format. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;Topographic maps on CD-ROM are a new product for the USGS,&quot; said James R.

They have been used to collect digital cartographic data and to revise maps. When combined with digital aerial photographs or digital terrain models, DRG data can be used to produce hybrid products, such as image maps and shaded relief maps. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEach DRG file has its own descriptive file that provides information including file identification, data sources and dates, scanning specifications and georeferencing information.

A 6.5 earthquake was recorded in the Aleutian Islands on April 23. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe second-largest felt earthquake in the U.S. during 1995 was a 5.8 tremor, September 20, near Ridgecrest, Calif., in the Mojave Desert, northeast of Los Angeles. Although this earthquake has been followed by thousands of smaller aftershocks, no deaths, injuries or major damage have been attributed to the earth movements. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe third-largest earthquake in the U.S. during 1995 occurred in Brewster County, Texas, April 14.

The amount of clay minerals on the surface of Mars is much lower than expected, and these low values may provide another clue to deciphering the mystery concerning life on Mars. \n<p>\"These extremely low clay contents--no more than 2 percent of the amounts found on Earth--point to a fundamental difference between the Earth and Mars,\" said USGS geophysicist Roger Clark. \"Surface composition is an important piece in the puzzle as we work toward understanding a planet&rsquo;s past history.\" \r\n<p>Some scientists believe that clays are important to the formation of life, perhaps as surfaces to which large molecules could stick. If clays never formed in abundance on Mars, life may not have been able to develop. If clays are being destroyed by some process, that process might also be hostile to life. \r\n<p>\"The clay data from Mars are forcing us to rethink our ideas of how the surface of Mars developed,\" Clark said. \"The more we learn about the way planets form and change, the better we will understand our own planet and its future.\" \r\n<p>For decades scientists have debated the mineral composition of the martian surface. Its red color was assumed to be caused by the presence of weathered iron oxides--also known as rust. Since iron oxides and clay are common products of the weathering process on Earth, they were assumed to be equally common on Mars. \r\n<p>None of the spacecraft that have landed on Mars so far have been able to directly determine what minerals are present on Mars. The primary mission of the NASA Viking Landers was to provide data on whether life had ever existed on Mars. \r\n<p>To help make an indirect comparison of the minerals of Earth and Mars, Clark and his USGS colleague Brad Dalton are using a new remote-sensing spectrometer to map large portions of the western United States. The spectrometer, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Visual and Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), captures a spectral image of the ground every 17 meters (about 60 feet). These Western desert regions are the first arid areas on Earth to be mapped by using the new technique. Because the surface of Mars is like an extreme desert, the arid parts of the western United States should be a reasonable model. \r\n<p>Clark and Dalton have analyzed the data for more than 1,100 square kilometers of California, Nevada, and Utah and compared them to spectral data for Mars. They found many similarities in the shapes of the spectra but a few crucial differences. In particular, Mars has very little of one clay mineral, montmorillonite, that is abundant in the western United States. \r\n<p>\"Clays are relatively stable minerals on Earth, so these results are puzzling,\" Clark said. \"Did the martian surface never form clay in its weathering process? Or were the martian clay minerals destroyed in some way after they formed? Past studies of Mars have simply assumed the same basic composition and weathering patterns as are found on Earth, but these results contradict that easy assumption. There must be a fundamental difference between the geologic history of Mars and that of the Earth.\" \r\n<p>The Mars Global Surveyor mission, which NASA plans to launch late next year, may help scientists resolve the enigma of the martian surface and lead to new insights on how the planets of our Solar System develop.

Ground-water withdrawals are greatest in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with the four largest withdrawal areas near Chicago, Ill.; South Bend, Ind.; Dayton, Ohio and Memphis, Tenn. \r\n<p>* The upper part of the rock mass that underlies the five-state region generally contains freshwater while the middle and lower sections contain saltwater. The source of the freshwater is rain and snow. Most of the precipitation that percolates downward and becomes ground water circulates through the shallow aquifers; only a small part enters the deep aquifers. \r\n<p>* The principal aquifers in the area are composed of consolidated limestone and sandstone and unconsolidated, near-surface sand and gravel deposits that overlie the consolidated rocks. Three times as much water is withdrawn from the near-surface sand and gravel aquifers in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, than from any other aquifer in the five-state region. \r\n<p>* Ground-water quality in the sand and gravel aquifer of Ohio, Illinois and Indiana is generally good. Nitrate concentrations at some places in Illinois and Ohio exceed the Maximum Contaminant Level of 10 milligrams per liter established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. The high concentrations are probably due to ground-water contamination by fertilizer or septic tank effluent. \r\n<p>* Ground-water from the near-surface sand and gravel aquifers generally has high concentrations of dissolved solids, hardness-causing constituents and iron. Iron concentrations in water from Illinois and Indiana commonly are high enough to cause staining of laundry and porcelain plumbing fixtures. \r\n<p>* Contaminated and turbid water can present problems in wells withdrawing water from the near-surface limestone aquifers in the southern parts of the area, which includes an extensive system of springs and caves. \r\n<p>* The water quality in a limestone aquifer in Tennessee is adequate, or can be treated and made adequate for most uses.

USGS oceanographer Bruce Jaffe, Menlo Park, Calif., will tell fellow scientists that this \"inlet bypassing\" of sediment is the result of currents and wave action during large storms and hurricanes, rather than normal river flows. Jaffe will present his paper at 1:45 p.m., Wednesday, Nov. 8. \r\n<p>Crawdads; Super Survivors: The thousands of crayfish that will be consumed by the visiting scientists next week have changed little since their species first appeared on Earth about 240 million years ago, according to Steve Hasiotis, a USGS paleontologist from Denver, Colo. Knowing the details of ancient crayfish life and habitat is important for modern-day aquaculturists, according to Hasiotis, who derives much of his information on the crustaceans by studying their fossilized burrows. Hasiotis will present his findings at 8:30 a.m., Tuesday, Nov. 7. \r\n<p>Everglades Ecosystem: A century of draining the Everglades in southern Florida has changed its natural ecosystem almost beyond recognition. Three USGS researchers will describe a series of efforts to understand the region&rsquo;s ecosystem, a necessary step before a successful restoration can begin. Hydrologist John Vecchioli, of the USGS in Tallahassee, will describe the USGS contribution to a massive intergovernmental effort to restore the natural water regime in parts of South Florida and allow the Everglades ecosystem to recover. Lynn Wingard, a geologist in Reston, Va., will summarize techniques for reconstructing ecosystem history in South Florida. By analyzing fossils from shallow cores, she and her colleagues can tell what has happened to the local ecosystems, on land and sea, over the past 100 years.

Hydrologic aspects of the severe flooding that occurred in southeast Texas in October, 1994, are described. USGS hydrologists recorded new all-time high streamflows at 23 streamflow measuring stations in the flooded area, which included 38 counties in southeast Texas. One hundred-year flood levels or greater were measured at 19 stations in the flooded area.

Schoenberg. In cooperation with the Minnesota Dept. Of Natural Resources, Division of Natural Waters, the USGS conducted a study documenting ground-water level declines in the Twin Cities., Minn., area in the 1980&rsquo;s. Water -levels in the Prairie du Chien aquifer have declined by an average of two feet and levels in the Mt. Simon-Hinckley aquifer have declined by an average of 43 feet. If withdrawals from the aquifers continue at current or increasing rates, due to continuing suburban growth, water-level declines in the Twin Cities area will probably continue.

BERING SURGES NEARLY HALF A MILE","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>\"After seven months of near-stagnation, Alaska&rsquo;s Bering Glacier resumed surging. Between May 19th and June 1, part of the glacier advanced almost half a mile (about 2,500 ft). As of mid-September, the surge was continuing,\" said Bruce F. Molnia, leader of the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s Bering Glacier Research Project. \n<p>Bering, the largest surging glacier on Earth, is located in coastal south-central Alaska. Much of the glacier is on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. \r\n<p>Continued surging of Bering Glacier could have significant economic impacts. Icebergs calved from the glacier could threaten nearby Pacific Ocean shipping routes. In addition, rising water trapped by a glacier ice dam could flood coastal plain rivers, possibly destroying a $20 million salmon fishery. \r\n<p>A surge occurs when water becomes trapped underneath a glacier, breaking its contact with its bed. The resulting dislocation allows the glacier to slide rapidly. \"The glacier acts like a hydroplaning car on a rain-slick highway. During a surge, rates of ice motion may increase as much as 100 times. In the current surge, the glacier has moved as much as 70 feet a day,\" said Molnia. \r\n<p>In 1993-94, Bering Glacier had experienced a major, 17-month-long surge that ended in September 1994. During that surge, part of Bering&rsquo;s terminus advanced nearly six miles, iceberg production increased substantially, and the size and the water chemistry of Vitus Lake, the large marine embayment at the glacier&rsquo;s edge, changed radically. The advancing ice covered many of the islands within Vitus Lake. These islands were the locations of rookeries of many species of waterfowl, including a severely stressed population of dusky Canada geese. \r\n<p>The first evidence that a new surge had begun was noted by USGS volunteers Gayle and Steve Ranney. On April 14, 1995, they observed that a section of the winter-ice cover of Vitus Lake was being disturbed, resulting in a series of accordion-like folds. They also saw numerous deep, fresh cracks, rifts, and blue-water lakes forming on the glacier&rsquo;s surface -- features characteristic of the 1993-94 surge. \r\n<p>The Ranneys, who operate a Cordova-based air charter service, fly a weekly U.S. Mail route along the Gulf of Alaska coast, which gives them ample opportunity to monitor changes in Bering Glacier. Their observations made before April 14th and USGS aerial photographs of the glacier&rsquo;s terminus region taken in late November 1994 and again in late January 1995, showed no evidence of surge activity. \r\n<p>On May 1, 1995, new aerial photography of the glacier and lake, collected under the supervision of Robert Krimmel (USGS, Tacoma), confirmed the new fracturing and rifting, as well as the numerous lakes. When compared to the November 1994 photography, the May 1995 photographs also showed that the terminus was advancing over the north end of Beringia Noyava, the largest island in Vitus Lake, and over the central part of Pointed Island. The margin was producing a significant number of icebergs, including several bergs that were more than a third of a mile long. \r\n<p>Aerial photography obtained by Steve Ranney on May 19, 1995, confirmed that the terminus was still advancing. On the southeast shoreline of the lake, the advancing ice margin forced the entire drainage from the eastern part of the glacier to flow in a narrow channel. There, parts of the shoreline were retreating more than 15 feet per day, resulting in the development of a high bluff. \r\n<p>In the new 1995 surge, the nests of many species of birds were covered by the advancing glacier, especially on Pointed Island. On May 19th, about one-half mile of the island was exposed. By June 1, the rapidly advancing ice moved the length of the island, leaving only the southernmost 200 feet of the island ice free.

In California, he played a similar pivotal role in explaining the subsidence of the Santa Clara Valley, and in helping to draft the groundwater segment of the California Water Plan. \r\n<p>Poland, who was born and raised in Boston, Mass., was educated at Harvard and Stanford. After working as a petroleum geologist during the 1930s, he joined the USGS in 1940. When the USGS opened a regional office in Sacramento in 1949, Poland headed up that office, supervising statewide hydrogeology investigations and related research programs. His leadership during those years led to the delineation of the major aquifer systems of California and their storage capacity, which proved to be so essential to development of the California Water Plan. \r\n<p>From 1956 to his retirement in 1974, he served as research geologist in charge of a multimillion-dollar state-federal cooperative research program on land subsidence and a federal research program on the mechanics of aquifer systems. Over several years of observation, Poland determined that the Santa Clara Valley was sinking at an average rate of four inches per year due to extensive groundwater pumping. In 1977 he showed that areas of the San Joaquin Valley had sunk as much as 30 feet in 50 years, due to aquifer compaction caused by groundwater pumping. \r\n<p>In addition to directing research in California, he investigated land subsidence in other parts of the United States and areas of the world, through the auspices of the United Nations, UNESCO and the World Bank. \r\n<p>(more--Poland) \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>2--Poland \r\n<p>Poland was a founding member of the Association of Engineering Geologists and a \"fellow\" of the Geological Society of America.

He founded the pioneering Earth Satellite Corporation (EarthSat) in 1969 after directing the development of NASA&rsquo;s first Earth Resources Technology Satellite, later named Landsat. The development of Landsat opened Porter&rsquo;s eyes to the potential of Earth-orbiting satellites (EOS) for determining vast amounts of critical information about worldwide resources. \r\n<p>Mr. Porter cited EarthSat&rsquo;s pioneering work in the use of space imagery for locating oil and gas reserves as one of his company&rsquo;s most significant accomplishments. \"By placing the exploration geologist and the physicist side by side in front of a computer workstation, we have been able to develop image processing algorithms which have revolutionized regional and frontier exploration.\" Mr. Porter recalled that the primary objective of NASA&rsquo;s early remote sensing programs was to increase knowledge of the environment. \"The EOS program is a logical and necessary extension of the research of the past three decades. Our use of these data for a wide variety of environmental projects strongly suggests that continuing investment in EOS will provide the best assurance that future generations will have the data they need to establish and maintain a global environmental equilibrium.\" \r\n<p>In the mid-1970&rsquo;s, EarthSat created CROPCAST&reg;, a global agricultural commodity forecasting system that combines data from meteorological satellites with ground observations to monitor global food production. Today, over 100,000 subscribers receive pre-harvest CROPCAST estimates on more than 20 commodities. Mr. Porter noted that EarthSat&rsquo;s agricultural and weather programs are a harbinger of a new remote sensing age where the product is information which serves the need of many, while the cost for each subscriber is minimal, and the delivery is instantaneous. \r\n<p>Throughout his career, Porter has continued to play an active role in formulating national remote sensing policy. He has served on the Space Applications Board of the National Research Council, the Land Remote Sensing Advisory Committee of the Department of Commerce, and the GEOSAT committee.

Between individual ice age events, the Earth&rsquo;s sea level has varied as much as almost 200 meters [660 feet]&quot; said USGS geologist Richard S. Williams, Jr., senior editor of the atlas series. &quot;The impact of even small amounts of sea-level change in low-lying coastal areas, where most humans live, may be significant. This global baseline study is necessary to assess worldwide changes in glaciers and potential accompanying changes in sea level over the next few decades.&quot; \r\n<p>\r\nA comprehensive baseline of the Earth&rsquo;s glaciers during the 1970s will result from the atlas series, &quot;Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World.&quot; This series represents an international project that is coordinated by the USGS. The project compares up-to-date field information about the glaciers and historical data with optimum Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images to determine changes in the Earth&rsquo;s glaciers. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nUntil recently, studying the extent of Greenland glaciers has been difficult. Uniform aerial photography of the entire coastal region was only achieved in 1987. Compilation of maps using geodetic satellite positioning techniques to accurately determine geographical positions of the northern parts of the island is progressing. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe great areal extent of the Inland Ice makes it difficult to observe and study the ice sheet in its entirety. Estimates of ice-covered and ice-free areas, based on a newly compiled map of Greenland, are presented in this atlas. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nEach Landsat image covers about 35,000 square kilometers (13,500 square miles), almost the combined areas of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Landsat images were used to outline areas of ablation and accumulation of the outer parts of the Inland Ice and determine if the ice is growing or receding. Preliminary results reported in the new atlas indicate that the Inland Ice is in equilibrium, neither growing nor receding. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Inland Ice, Northern Hemisphere&rsquo;s largest remnant of the Earth&rsquo;s most recent ice age, is 1,736,095 square kilometers (670,272 square miles, or more than the combined areas of Alaska and Oregon) and covers about 80 percent of Greenland.

An explosive eruption could send blocks of old volcanic material, hot mudflows, and cascades of hot pumice and ash down slope threatening the lives and livelihood of the island&rsquo;s 12,000 residents. \r\n<p>Steam and ash have been erupting from a vent that formed July 28, and sulfur dioxide emissions have averaged between 100 and 300 metric tons\/day and peaked at 1,200 metric tons\/day. The current level is about 100 metric tons\/day. \r\n<p>In general, earthquake activity at the volcano has been increasing since July 14, and the depths of earthquakes appear to have changed from 5-6 km to 2-5 km beneath the volcano&rsquo;s vent. This trend will be watched closely to better assess the various eruption styles this volcanic system may produce. \r\n<p>In response to increased volcanic activity since July 18, government officials have temporarily evacuated residents who live east and northeast of the volcano&rsquo;s crater to the northern part of the island. Infirm and elderly residents living west and southwest of the crater also have been moved to the northern part of the island. \r\n<p>Montserrat is one of the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles, a north-south chain of active volcanic islands in the Caribbean Sea. The island nation has experienced three volcano-seismic crises during the past 100 years. A series of small earthquakes occurred April 23-27, 1897, with subsequent events occurring intermittently through October 1900. A second series started March 1933, peaked November 1935, and tapered off by late 1937. Yet another series accompanied by sulfur gas discharges began in January 1966, and continued through November 1967. The pattern of earthquake activity from this series was strikingly similar to the 1933-37 episode. USGS and Seismic Research Unit scientists will compare newly gathered data with past data to make best estimates of what course the volcano may take. \r\n<p>Ash clouds from the continuing volcano-seismic activity of Soufriere Hills can disrupt and threaten air traffic in the vicinity of the volcano.

Development of canals for flood control of agricultural and urban lands over the last 100 years has led to the drainage of approximately 50 percent of the Everglades. This drainage and reduction in the flow of freshwater to Florida Bay have caused dramatic changes to flora and fauna in both the Everglades and Florida Bay. Drainage has also resulted in intrusion of saltwater into freshwater aquifers, and has affected the quantity and quality of the water supply for southeast Florida&rsquo;s urban corridor.

The SAST team compiled maps that show the extent of flooding, historical changes in stream channels, existing habitat locations, and other information to assist in river-basin management.

As a federal bureau, we must do our part in reducing the cost of government. We have trimmed our staff by about 10 percent during the past budget year, and must assume we will be asked to do even more belt tightening in the years ahead.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;The new USGS must work harder to reach and serve its customers better,&quot; Eaton said. &quot;We serve every citizen every day in some way. Whether it&rsquo;s through the water, energy and mineral resources they use, or the roads, urban developments and wilderness areas that are based on our maps, we are at work on behalf of every citizen in every state. But we need to do a better job of communicating the results of our science so that the information is more readily available and easier to use.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;To focus our efforts even more sharply at the state level, I am assigning new responsibility to a senior USGS official in each state to provide a bureauwide focus on what we are doing and to seek mutually beneficial opportunities to do more,&quot; the USGS Director said.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n&quot;I am also pleased to announce the availability of a new series of fact sheets summarizing our work in every state,&quot; Eaton said. &quot;We are now making these fact sheets and other basic information, such as earthquake and streamflow data, more widely available to the public through Internet and a new fax-on-demand system as well as our 800 phone number (1-800-ASK-USGS) and the traditional mail and over-the-counter services. We are determined to serve the citizen and our cooperators even better in the future.&quot; \r\n<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["National News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"803016000","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"169271"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}},{"title":"Ethridge Named Rolla Mapping Center Chief","status":"1","comment":"0","promote":"0","sticky":"0","body":{"und":[{"value":"<p>Dr. Max M.

Highlights of his years with NOAA included service as Executive Officer aboard the NOAA ship WHITING, a hydrographic survey ship, and three years as Chief of the National Geodetic Survey at the rank of Captain in the NOAA Corps.<\/p>\r\n<p>A native of Aurora, Missouri, Ethridge graduated from the University of Missouri -- Rolla in 1970 with a BS degree in Civil Engineering before assuming the rank of Lieutenant Ensign onboard his first NOAA ship. He subsequently earned Masters degrees in Civil Engineering and Public Administration and a Ph.D. in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from Purdue University.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ethridge is married to the former Martha Thompson of Webster, Texas. Mrs. Ethridge is an algebra and trigonometry teacher. The couple have two daughters; Marcia, a spring, 1995 graduate in mechanical engineering from Virginia Tech, and Marguerite, who recently graduated from high school.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Mid-Continent Mapping Center employs close to 400 people involved in all aspects of gathering topographical data, preparing, and updating maps of the central United States. Topographic maps made at the center are among the best known products of the USGS, which has produced more than 88,500 different maps. About 54,000 maps are required to cover the lower 48 States at a working scale of 1:24,000 (1 inch equals 2,000 feet).<\/p>","summary":null,"format":null}]},"field_images":[],"regions":["Missouri"],"country":["United States of America"],"mm_tags":[""],"article_type":["State News Release"],"release_date":{"und":[{"value":"802670400","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datestamp"}]},"contacts":{"und":[{"tid":"170159"}]},"subtitle":{"und":[{"value":"","format":null,"safe_value":""}]}}]
