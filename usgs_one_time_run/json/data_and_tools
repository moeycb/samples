For century upon century, frogs, salamanders and other aquatic species flourished in these high-elevation habitats where food was plentiful and their eggs and young were relatively safe from predators.&nbsp; In the late 1800s, however, things started to change when settlers looking for recreational fishing opportunities carried and released non-native trout into wilderness areas. &nbsp;Widespread stocking started after World War II with wildlife agencies dropping millions of fish from repurposed military aircraft.&nbsp; While many high-alpine stocking programs have ceased in the American West, self-sustaining populations of trout still exist in most high lakes.<\/p><p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

Jack Oelfke, Chief of Resources at the North Cascades National Park (NCNP) in the far North of the state of Washington, says he has watched long-toed salamanders, northwestern salamanders, and tailed frogs recover quickly in seven lakes where crews began removal of introduced trout in 2009.&nbsp; This ability of amphibians to naturally recolonize restored sites is one of the strengths of the approach. &nbsp;\u201cAmphibians are amazing and they will return on their own. They\u2019ll walk over dry passes and snow to get there. They\u2019ll find the ponds,\u201d Ryan reiterated.<\/p><p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Regina Rochefort, a co-author on the paper and science advisor at NCNP, hopes that this analysis and future work by the group will help guide NCNP\u2019s trout removal program.&nbsp; Managers currently use a variety of criteria to determine where to apply fish removal strategies, including lake size, whether the fish reproduce, and whether they can travel out of the lake into lower elevation waterways where they may compete with native fish.&nbsp; \u201cAdding climate vulnerability considerations will help NPS managers focus fish removal efforts in the highest priority areas for maximum ecological pay off.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(240, 240, 240); max-width: 96%; padding: 5px 3px 10px; float: right; clear: none; margin: 5px 0px 20px 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; width: 310px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/05_01_2014_c28Ja44YYt_05_01_2014_0\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 192); outline: none;\"><img alt=\"Cascades Frog\" height=\"225\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/05_01_2014\/c28Ja44YYt_05_01_2014\/medium\/cascades_frog.jpg\" style=\"border-style: none; height: auto; margin: 0px; max-width: 98.5%; padding: 0px; width: auto;\" width=\"300\"><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 4px 5px;\">A Cascades frog peeks out of the water in Olympic National Park.<\/p><\/div><p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\"><strong>Frogs&nbsp;<em>and<\/em>&nbsp;Fishing?<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Not everyone likes the idea of removing trout from mountain lakes.&nbsp; The 100-plus-year history of fish stocking and recreational fishing in wilderness areas represents cultural values that Rochefort said the National Park Service seeks to address alongside its mission of preserving biodiversity and the ecological integrity of wilderness landscapes in the 21<sup>st<\/sup>&nbsp;Century.&nbsp; Rochefort supports working with recreational fishing groups to find common ground between the interests of backcountry fisherman and climate-smart conservation of lake and wetland ecosystems.<\/p><p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Michael Adams points out that managing for amphibians and for fishing can be compatible.&nbsp; \u201cPeople often ask me what we can do about amphibian declines.

They\u2019ll walk over dry passes and snow to get there. They\u2019ll find the ponds,\u201d Ryan reiterated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Regina Rochefort, a co-author on the paper and science advisor at NCNP, hopes that this analysis and future work by the group will help guide NCNP\u2019s trout removal program.\u00a0 Managers currently use a variety of criteria to determine where to apply fish removal strategies, including lake size, whether the fish reproduce, and whether they can travel out of the lake into lower elevation waterways where they may compete with native fish.\u00a0 \u201cAdding climate vulnerability considerations will help NPS managers focus fish removal efforts in the highest priority areas for maximum ecological pay off.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(240, 240, 240); max-width: 96%; padding: 5px 3px 10px; float: right; clear: none; margin: 5px 0px 20px 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; width: 310px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/photos\/05_01_2014_c28Ja44YYt_05_01_2014_0\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 192); outline: none;\"><img alt=\"Cascades Frog\" height=\"225\" src=\"http:\/\/gallery.usgs.gov\/images\/05_01_2014\/c28Ja44YYt_05_01_2014\/medium\/cascades_frog.jpg\" style=\"border-style: none; height: auto; margin: 0px; max-width: 98.5%; padding: 0px; width: auto;\" width=\"300\" \/><\/a><br \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" style=\"font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px 4px 5px;\">A Cascades frog peeks out of the water in Olympic National Park.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\"><strong>Frogs\u00a0<em>and<\/em>\u00a0Fishing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Not everyone likes the idea of removing trout from mountain lakes.\u00a0 The 100-plus-year history of fish stocking and recreational fishing in wilderness areas represents cultural values that Rochefort said the National Park Service seeks to address alongside its mission of preserving biodiversity and the ecological integrity of wilderness landscapes in the 21<sup>st<\/sup>\u00a0Century.\u00a0 Rochefort supports working with recreational fishing groups to find common ground between the interests of backcountry fisherman and climate-smart conservation of lake and wetland ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">Michael Adams points out that managing for amphibians and for fishing can be compatible.\u00a0 \u201cPeople often ask me what we can do about amphibian declines. Fish removal is something that we know will help, but is hard to do and not always popular, so we need to be smart about it. This project provides a tool that can help target fish removal to places where it will do the most good for amphibians and leave many of the most popular fishing sites accessible for people to enjoy backcountry fishing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;\">The research was supported by the Department of the Interior\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.doi.gov\/csc\/northwest\/index.cfm\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 192); outline: none;\">Northwest Climate Science Center<\/a>, by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.northpacificlcc.org\/\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 192); outline: none;\">North Pacific Landscape Conservation Cooperative<\/a>\u00a0and the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.conbio.org\/mini-sites\/smith-fellows\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 192); outline: none;\">Smith Fellows Program<\/a>.
