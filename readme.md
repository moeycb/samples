# Overview
This repo contains sample code that was developed for the USGS portal site http://usgs.gov.  The modules are dependent on the USGS
distribution which I am unable to provide due to non-disclosure agreements.
  
  There are two directories in this repo - one that contains the custom modules and the
  other that contains the sub-theme created.

[custom_modules](https://gitlab.com/marvoey/samples/tree/master/custom_modules)
[custom_theme](https://gitlab.com/marvoey/samples/tree/master/custom_theme/usgs_bootstrap)

This is not a full Drupal distribution and I have attempted to provide readme files in the directories of the modules and theme.
